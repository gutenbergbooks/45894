<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The contents of the following pages are presented to the
public as matters of fact. They embody some of the writer's
experiences while serving his country in the "land of cotton."
It is true his experiences are tame and unromantic when compared
with those of some of the men of the Potomac or the
Cumberland; but they are the best he can offer, and need no
apology, as the style does, which is rough and unpolished.</p>

<p>Besides giving an account of the 17th Mass. Reg't, and its
participation in the engagements at Kinston, Whitehall, and
Goldsboro, something is said of the other old regiments in the
department, and the nine months' men,&mdash;also, an account of
the contrabands, their habits and disposition&mdash;anecdotes, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="chap" />



<h2>DEDICATION.</h2>

<p class="center">To the officers and men of the Seventeenth Massachusetts<br />
Regiment, who, through no fault of theirs, have only<br />
lacked the opportunities to render their organization<br />
as famous as that of any regiment from<br />
the old Bay State: whose services have<br />
been mostly of that passive character<br />
&mdash;upon the outpost picket, and<br />
performing arduous duty in<br />
the midst of a malarial<br />
country&mdash;that suffers<br />
and endures much<br />
without exciting<br />
comment or adding<br />
to the laurels, of which<br />
every true soldier is so proud:<br /><br />

THIS HUMBLE WORK IS DEDICATED,<br /><br />

By one who, with them, has braved the "pestilence that walketh<br />
abroad at noonday," the fatigues of the march,<br />
and the dangers of the battle.<br /></p>

<p>It has been said that man is essentially a "fighting animal,"&mdash;that
in this "world's broad field of battle" his life, from the
cradle to the grave, is one continued struggle against want and
its attendant circumstances,&mdash;and that he is the greatest who,
be his position what it may, acts well his part. If this be true&mdash;and
I think it is&mdash;then the man who goes to the war only
exchanges one mode of strife for another&mdash;"the whips and
scorns of time," for interminable drilling, "hard tack and salt
horse,"&mdash;"the oppressor's wrong," for the hardships of the march
and the dangers of the battle,&mdash;"the proud man's contumely,"
for the murmurings at home that he does not "clean
out" the rebels in a week or two,&mdash;"the law's delay," for the
tedium of garrison and camp life,&mdash;"the insolence of office,"
for the rule (not always gentle or humane) of men placed over
him,&mdash;and the "bare bodkin," for the sword and the bayonet.

<p>The severe checks and disasters experienced by the Union
arms in the Spring campaign of 1862, culminating in the "seven
days' fight" before Richmond, and the retreat of McClellan's
noble but suffering and crippled army to James river, while it
spread sorrow and mourning throughout the land, had the effect
of awakening those in power to a full sense of the nation's peril.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
When the President called for more men, thereby giving effect
to the wishes of the loyal people, I was one of those who helped
to swell the volume of that mighty response which echoed back
from the hills and prairies, cities and villages, towns and hamlets:</p>


<p class="center">"We are coming, father Abraham, three hundred thousand more!"</p>


<p>Like others, I had to mourn the loss of a friend,&mdash;a brave
young fellow, who was killed in the second of the "seven days'
fight," and determined to fill his place, if I could.</p>

<p>On the 4th of August, 1862, I entered my name as a "raw
recruit" for Co. F, 19th Mass. Reg't, as one of the quota of the
town of Malden. A friend, struck by my example, or, perhaps,
being in that state of mind which needs but little to turn one
way or the other, joined with me; but upon going to the office
in Boston where enlistments for the 19th were "done up," we
were told recruiting for it was stopped. How times have altered
since then,&mdash;now, I believe, it would take a battalion to fill it.
We were in a fix (at least I was, who wished to go in the 19th),
but there was a remedy at hand. A recruiting officer for the
17th, who had an office in Union street, received us willingly,
and after being examined and sworn in, we were packed off,
with some twenty other recruits, to Camp Cameron in North
Cambridge. It was late in the evening when we arrived there,
and no preparation being made for us&mdash;owing, I suppose, to the
constant and rapid influx of recruits, which taxed to their utmost
the various departments to fit out and provide for,&mdash;we had to
turn in, supperless, to a bunk of downy boards, with no covering
but our thin citizens' summer clothes. I thought it was a very
uncomfortable resting place at the time, but it was nothing to
what I have since known in the way of sleeping accommodation.
The next morning I had leisure to look around me and take a
survey of the mass of human nature that there commingled for
the first time. And truly it was a heterogeneous compound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
representatives of nearly every race of people in Europe, and
plentifully sprinkled among them was the leaven of the whole&mdash;smart,
shrewd, intelligent, quick-eyed and quick-witted Americans.
And such a confusing babble as prevailed I never heard
before. Wrangling and swearing, drinking and eating, talking
and laughing,&mdash;all combined to give me no very agreeable foretaste
of what I had to expect in my new vocation. I noticed
others, new, like myself, to such scenes, who seemed mentally
dumbfounded, or unconsciously comparing the quiet routine of
the life they led at home to the new one they had assumed, and,
no doubt, to the great advantage of the former and dislike for
the latter. But happily for us all, being the creatures of circumstances,
the pliability of our natures leads us to be quickly
reconciled to our lot, whatever it may be. The change of life
from a citizen to that of a soldier is so radical that few like it at
first; but by degrees it becomes endurable, and finally, often,
desirable. The recent re-enlistments prove this.</p>

<p>There were several "characters" among the recruits in camp,
to whom, if I could, I would devote a few pages, as well as to
management of the camp and the method of dovetailing a little
<em>innocent</em> private business into that of the public, as practiced by
some of the little-great men in authority there; but as paper
costs 22 cents per pound, I am warned that I must leave out
here and condense there, which is not so pleasant after all.</p>

<p>Men were arriving every day in squads of from twenty to
fifty, and leaving at intervals in detachments of from 100 to 500,
to be distributed among their respective regiments at the seat of
war. At length our turn came. It was on a Friday.&mdash;Now,
Friday, though generally considered by superstitious persons an
unlucky day, has often proved a lucky one for me. I was born
on Friday; was married on Friday; and now I started to go to
the war on Friday. I shouldn't wonder if on some Friday in
the future I would die&mdash;and that will be another great event in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
my life. Well, we started on a Friday afternoon, and taking
the cars at the Old Colony depot in Boston and the boat at Fall
River, found ourselves next morning in the city of New York.
We were quartered in barracks on White street, furnished with
filthy beds, miserable "grub," and allowed free range of the city.
A lieutenant (from Haverhill, I believe) had charge of our
squad, which numbered about a hundred, and some of his enthusiastic
admirers in the crowd presented him with a sword.
There was, of course, a presentation speech, enthusiastic,
pathetic, patriotic and warlike, and a response suitable and
sentimental. It made a good impression on me at the time; but
then I had yet to learn the difference between what an Indian
would call "talk fight" and "fightem."</p>

<p>On the following Monday afternoon, with all "traps" snugly
bestowed and knapsacks strapped on, we were drawn up in
front of the barracks, when the lieutenant stepped out in front
and proposed three cheers for the barrack-master, which were
given; but I did not join in, even in dumb show, having too
much conscientiousness to outrage the finer feelings of my stomach
by cheering for an individual who had cheated and abused it.
We then took up our line of march for the transport, and went
along almost unnoticed save by a few patriotic individuals who
bade us a fervent God-speed and wished that good-fortune might
attend us wherever we went; but the great mass seemed hardened
to the sight of their fellow men going away from amongst
them to explore unknown fields of danger, and to purchase with
their life's blood a continuance and perpetuity of that nationality
which has made the United States of America the first among
nations. As these thoughts entered my mind, they suggested
the picture of the hundreds of thousands of devoted men who
passed through this great city, with all their hardest and most
bitter experiences&mdash;hardships and dangers, sickness and death&mdash;before
them, many, very many of them to return again no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
more; and I began to realize that, though still in a land of peace
and plenty, a few days would bring me out upon far different
scenes and into circumstances that would require a bold heart
to meet as they ought to be met. Luckily for us all, the future
cannot be penetrated, or we should be mourning calamities
before they befall us; dreading dangers before they threaten,
and finally become unmanned at the awful prospect impending
over our future. Still there is in the expectancy of danger
something that is fascinating, and something, too, that even
while we dread we seek; and this feeling, the result of a strange
curiosity, enlivened by hope and the love of excitement, is what
often keeps up the spirit of the soldier and urges him on, even
when worn out with fatigue and well-nigh exhausted, to renewed
energy and more determined acts of bravery.</p>

<p>The transport we embarked upon was a dilapidated steamer
called the "Haze" (who that ever took passage in her to or from
Dixie can forget the old tub?), a miserably appointed vessel,
whose officers and crew seemed better fitted for the penitentiary
than for the station they held. It was in this vessel that
I first learnt some of the hardships and inconveniences of a
soldier's life. Just before the hawser was cast off, an Irish
apple-woman came on board, her basket well laden with fruit,
and said&mdash;"Come, me poor boys; it's not many of these ye'll get
in the place ye're goin' to&mdash;so help yerselves! 'Tis all I have to
give ye, except me blessin'&mdash;and may God bless ye all, and
bring ye safe back agin to the frinds ye have at home!"</p>

<p>She then proceeded to distribute the apples (and fine ones
they were) to the boys, many of whom, thinking more of the
apples than the blessing, rushed eagerly in saying, "bully for
you, old lady!" nearly overturning her in their desire to possess
as much of the fruit as possible. As for me, I was content to
let them have the fruit&mdash;the blessing and good wishes of the
warm-hearted old woman was all-sufficient for my desires. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
stepped ashore, and as she disappeared in the crowd on the
pier, I heard one of the lucky ones, who was luxuriating in the
fruits of his scramble, remark to another lucky one,&mdash;"D&mdash;d
good apples!&mdash;that's a bully old woman,&mdash;how did you like her
malediction?" "Big thing," was the response.</p>

<p>The hawser was finally cast off, and, backing slowly out of
the dock, the steamer was soon under full headway down the
bay. What my emotions were as I gazed (perhaps) for the last
time upon the surrounding scenes, I will not tire the reader by
giving expression to,&mdash;doubtless they resembled in a manner
those of thousands of others who had gone the same road before
me. My comrades, however, as a general thing, were merry,
and talked of the promised land (Dixie) in a tone that showed
how high their hopes ran; but presently, as we passed Sandy
Hook, and the regular and continuous swell of the ocean set in,
many who were before lively as kittens became tame and
wretched-looking enough. It was dark before we passed the
Highlands, and, though we could not see the Jersey shore we
heard of it from the breakers, here and there catching glimpses
of lights which told us that even among its barren sands many
had found homes. But let Jersey pass, and Delaware, and
Virginia's eastern shore&mdash;"away, away down South in Dixie"
we go. But how few, comparatively, of our detachment were
now so eager, after encountering one enemy, to meet another?
And yet, I verily believe, many of these poor fellows would
prefer at that time to run their chances in battle (if only on the
land) than be tossed about at the mercy of the waves and so
thoroughly sea-sick. As for me, whose somewhat eventful life
had often before sent me "down to the sea in ships," I had no
feelings of nausea, and consequently enjoyed the surroundings,
the fresh, bracing sea air seeming to instil new vigor into my
frame, which twenty years of toil in a printing office (with short
intermissions) had tended to impair. Thus situated I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
look about me, and I observed some who were formerly the
jolliest of our band now the saddest and most forlorn. One in
particular (a fine young fellow, whom we dubbed "the colonel")
who had been the life of our party, now, pale and sad, with not
a word to say, lay doubled up inside the coils of a hawser, as
forlorn as the Wandering Jew (by Eugene Sue). It was no
more, with him, "Away daown Saouth in a few days&mdash;hooray!"
We passed the Chesapeake, (Fortress Monroe,) Cape Henry
and the dismal coast beyond, and on the third evening neared
land to the north of Cape Hatteras.&mdash;But such land! A long,
low bar of sand, stretching away as far as the eye could reach,
relieved at intervals by huge hummocks covered with a stunted
growth of trees, whose ragged and forlorn limbs and inclined
position made them appear as if a fierce hurricane all the while
tore through their branches, threatening to uproot and cast them
away forever. "There," said I to the 'colonel,' who had come
upon deck when he heard we were near Hatteras, and stood
beside me grasping the rail,&mdash;"There is Dixie, my jolly 'colonel.'
We have come 'away daown Saouth in a few days,' haven't we;
and how do you like the lay of the land? What&mdash;can't you
even say 'hooray?'" But only a faint smile was the answer.
Shortly after dark we descried Hatteras light, which we neared
about ten o'clock; but the captain would not venture in, and so
we had to lay "off and on" till daylight, which was no pleasant
job, for "the wind rose and the rain fell," and gave those who
selected the deck for their sleeping place (myself among the
number), with the assistance of an occasional dash of salt water,
a pretty thorough soaking. As soon as it was clear day our
craft headed for the "swash," the wind blowing a small gale, the
rain coming in squalls as if some fretful genius presided over
this unhappy coast, and the waves running in shore like race-horses,
spreading their foam in a thin gray mist over the narrow
line of sand, which seemed endeavoring almost in vain to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
its back above the water. To our right, and north of the inlet,
were the forts taken by Gen. Butler in his first Coast Expedition.
Only one of these, Fort Hatteras, is now used. The other has
either sunk into the sand or been almost wholly destroyed by
the action of the waves. Fort Hatteras is an earthwork, but so
admirably situated as to prove an almost impassible barrier to
anything but ironclads. Beyond and around the fort on the
land or sand side, were a few buildings used for quarters for the
garrison and for ordnance stores. Anchored in the Sound,
near by, were supply ships, transports, and old hulks; while
here and there rows of disconsolate timbers, lifting their dripping
heads above the tide, told the fate of many a noble ship of the
glorious Expedition of Gen. Burnside. We "hove to" after
entering the Sound to deliver the mails for the Fort; and the
change from the violent rolling, tossing and pitching was such
as to inspire even my old friend the 'colonel' with something
of the spirit he was wont to display ere old Neptune changed
his tune. After taking a look at the Fort and its surroundings,
I turned my eyes to the opposite shore of the inlet, when lo,
there stretched out in an almost straight line from the point into
the Sound a troop or flock of&mdash;what? That was the puzzle
to my mind. Were they huge gulls or windbags, cormorants
or cranes, devils or dogfish? Fowl, flesh, or fish? I watched
them with close attention while asking myself these questions;
but ere my cogitations were finished they separated, spread
their wings and took flight, apparently, but it seemed strange
they did not rise from the surface of the water. They neared
us presently, and I made them out to be, instead of birds, small
sail-boats. "Love launched a fairy boat," &amp;c. No love for us
there, I guess, was my mental comment. "Pilots," I heard some
one say. They came fluking towards us, their comparatively
large sprit-sails hurrying them along at no contemptible rate of
speed. There were about fifteen of them, and it seemed evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
all could not get a job from our hazy skipper. "That's Jeff.'s
navy," remarked one.</p>

<p>"Hooray for the boat that's ahead!" sang out the 'colonel.'</p>

<p>"Bully for the little fellow with the big sail!" exclaimed
another.</p>

<p>"I'll bet on the cross-gaffed, giraffe-colored one!"</p>

<p>"Bully for the rip-staving roarer that wins!"</p>

<p>"Aint she a-ripping up the old salt water canvas, skearing
the sharks and astonishing the sea sarpints?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet Jeff.'s in that boat, and he's coming to ask us to dine
with him in Richmond!"</p>

<p>"Beauregard's in the second one!"</p>

<p>"No, <em>sir</em>, that's Stonewall Jackson!"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n Stonewall Jackson, or any other man!" and remarks
of a like character attested the interest felt in this novel contest
by others as well as myself. The boats were pelting away in
fine style, each having a loose rein. Then hurrah, my hearties!
the lucky man wins, and "first come first served!" Two of the
number were distinctly ahead of all the rest, and one of these
slightly ahead of the other.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But Cutty Sark, before the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard upon noble Maggie prest&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>so that when they came up it was difficult to say which was first,
and both came aboard to dispute the point, while the remaining
unsuccessful ones kept on, as if philosophically resigned to a fate
they could not overcome. Our hazy skipper, who was not very
particular about expenses when Uncle Sam had to foot the bills,
and to end all disputes, took both pilots&mdash;a piece of diplomacy I
hardly expected his thick head capable of conceiving. The
anchor was hoisted, and away we sped over the dark, swampy
waters of Pamlico Sound. Roanoke Island lay to our right, and
ever and anon we caught glimpses of the low, swampy lands of
Hyde and Plymouth counties. To the left or south we beheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a continuation of islands, and shortly after the main land of
Cartaret county became visible. It seemed almost wholly
unsettled, the wilderness appearance being only here and there
relieved by the small clearing of a turpentine plantation, fishing
establishment, or the twenty-acre field of a "poor white."</p>

<p>We soon made Neuse river&mdash;a noble stream, upon the banks
of which turpentine, pitch, rosin and tar enough might be made
to supply the markets of the North. As we ascended the
river the signs of habitation became more numerous although
seeming "few and far between" to the eye accustomed to the
more frequent settlements on Northern rivers, and the sombre
hues of the pine, cedar and cypress forests were occasionally
enlivened by the brighter foliage of persimmon, walnut and fig
trees, the last flourishing here in great luxuriance, bearing two
or rather a continuation of crops of delicious fruit in a season,
and may be seen on every farm or plantation in patches of from
a few trees to orchards of twenty-five acres in extent. We
could also trace the courses of the many "branches" or creeks
from the lighter foliage of the gum and other water-loving
trees.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we passed Slocum's Creek, where Burnside
landed his troops the evening before the battle of Newbern, and
soon the spires of this city, and the shipping, hove in sight; and
towards the close of the day, after a sail of ten hours, during
which time we steamed eighty or ninety miles, we drew up at
the pier and prepared to disembark, thankful that we could
again set foot on land and leave forever the accursed "Haze" and
her brutal captain and crew.</p>

<p>"Mind, I tell you," said one of the latter, "bad as you think
the old 'Haze' is, you will before long be glad to be on board of
her again&mdash;if you'd be <em>let</em>!"</p>

<p>He was laughed at; but I doubt not many of them, ere six
months elapsed, wished themselves anywhere else than where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they were. Still they could not see it then, but felt happy, like
young bears, with all their troubles before them.</p>

<p>The dilapidated and seedy condition of the wharves, and the
ruins of houses, mills and turpentine factories, impressed me
with a premonition of what I should yet witness of the ravages
of war in this fair land.</p>

<p>The city of Newbern bears the appearance of some age, is
regularly laid out, the streets intersecting each other at right
angles, and well protected from the merciless heat of summer
by fine old elm trees, intermixed here and there with the chaney
and other trees the names of which I do not recollect. The city
is located at a point of land formed by the junction of the Trent
river with the Neuse, and has altogether an imposing appearance
viewed from the approach by water.</p>

<p>The Mass. 23d Reg't, Col. Kurtz, (who was provost marshal,)
was then doing provost duty in the city.</p>

<p>When the order for landing was given, each scrambled ashore
with the whole of his household furniture upon his back. After
passing through a part of the city, we struck the railroad bridge,
(destroyed by the rebels after their defeat, but rebuilt by our
forces,) crossing which, and marching a mile or two, halted at
the encampment of the 17th on the Trent river, where we were
welcomed by the men of the various companies, many of whom
found friends and acquaintances among the 'raw recruits.' My
comrade had friends in the Malden Company (K), of which we
were henceforth to form a part, and we received a hearty welcome
from the members of mess 5, some of the good-natured ones
of which taxed themselves to the amount of nearly a dollar to
procure from the sutler something more palatable for our first
meal than 'hard tack and salt horse.'</p>

<p>After 'taps' the lights were put out, and we disposed ourselves
upon the tent-floor to sleep, in the manner of spokes of a cart-wheel,
our feet toward the hub, which consisted of the gun-rack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
around the tent-pole, there to revolve in the circle of dreams of
home and friends far distant. Before closing our eyes, however,
and while inquiries were plied and answered thick and fast, one
of the mess startled the newcomers by exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"A rat! A rat! I have him!"</p>

<p>"Pass him around!" was the general cry.</p>

<p>"Now I've got him!" another exclaimed. This was followed
by a gurgling noise, as in the first instance.</p>

<p>The 'rat' came nearer, and presently I smelt him. There
was no mistaking that 'rat,'&mdash;he came from Jersey and was
surnamed 'lightning,' and cost the fourth part of a soldier's pay
for one month. Being eagerly pressed to taste him, I did <em>taste</em>,
but that was all&mdash;the smell was enough, and I passed him over
to the next man.</p>

<p>Sleep at length overcome me, and I dreamed of rats made
of glass, squealing "Jersey lightning! Jersey lightning!" until
morning, when I awoke to find myself surrounded by comrades
busy eating breakfast. Beside me stood a dipper of smoking
hot coffee, some hard bread and salt beef, provided by one of
the most thoughtful of my new friends.</p>

<p>After guard-mounting (9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>) the recruits were drawn up
in line, assigned to the various companies, examined by the
surgeon, and, after a few words of encouragement or advice
from their captains (and mayhap a glass of whisky), returned to
their quarters, feeling relieved, no doubt, that the affair was
over.</p>

<p>Thus, in the course of about an hour, the recruits were
disposed of, and duly incorporated with the regiment&mdash;to share
in its messes and marches, its skirmishes and scratches, its picket
duty and plunder, its whisky and quinine, its tents and hospitals,
its hard tack and salt horse, its pea soup and pea coffee, its
baked beans without brown bread, its pride and its perils, its
glory and its graveyards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a list of the principal staff and line officers
of the 17th, the companies and where they were raised, together
with an account&mdash;taken from a diary or journal of Mr. Wm.
Noble, of Saugus, (the first color sergeant)&mdash;of the doings of the
regiment from its inception down to the 5th of January, 1862:</p>

<p><i>Colonel</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas I. C. Amory.</span></p>

<p>[Mr. Amory was born in Boston, Nov. 27, 1828; entered
West Point in 1846, and graduated in 1851, when he was appointed
2d lieutenant in the 7th Infantry, ordered to Fort Smith
in Arkansas, and was promoted 1st lieutenant in 1855. In 1858
he was ordered to Utah, under the command of the late Gen.
Albert Sidney Johnson, who joined the rebels at the outbreak
of the Southern rebellion and was killed at Shiloh; was ordered
to Boston on recruiting service in 1860, and was promoted to a
captaincy May 7, 1861. When the war broke out, he obtained
leave of absence from the War Department, and accepted a
commission from Gov. Andrew as Colonel of the 17th Mass.
Vols., on Sept. 7th, 1861. Since the regiment has been in the
Department of North Carolina, he has acted as General of
Brigade; but whether his nomination for the brigadiership has
been confirmed or not, I am unable to say. Of this I am certain,
however, that there are few officers at this time serving in
our armies better capable of wearing the star or more fully deserving
of it than Thomas I. C. Amory.]</p>

<p><i>Lieut. Colonel</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">John F. Fellows.</span></p>

<p>[Mr. Fellows, of Chelsea, is well known in Boston, having
been for many years connected with its daily press. He was
also an active member of the State Militia. When the war
broke out he offered his services to Gov. Andrew, from whom
he received a commission as Lieut. Colonel of the 17th Reg't on
the 21st of August, 1861. He has proved himself a capable
officer and a thoroughly brave man. I shall have frequent
occasion to speak of him hereafter.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Major</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jones Frankle.</span> (Now, <span class="smcap">Luther Day</span>.)</p>

<p>[Mr. Frankle is a Prussian by birth, and served in the war
of 1848 in Germany, at which time he did not "fight mit Sigel,"
but against him. He received his commission as Major of the
17th on the 1st of August, 1861; and proved himself a capable
and efficient officer. In June, 1863, he resigned his commission
in the 17th for the purpose of raising an artillery regiment (the
2d Mass. Heavy Artillery) which he now commands, and which
is doing duty in the field and in forts in the various parts of
North Carolina held by our forces. He was succeeded by senior
captain (Co. F) Luther Day, of Haverhill, a very good officer.]</p>

<p><i>Adjutant</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">B. N. Mann.</span> (Now, <span class="smcap">H. A. Cheever</span>.)</p>

<p>[Mr. Mann was, I believe, for many years connected with the
Boston Post Office. He is a brave man, and generous as he is
brave. He was succeeded by Mr. Cheever in the Fall of '62.]</p>

<p><i>Quartermaster</i>&mdash;Capt. <span class="smcap">Harris</span> was commissioned Quartermaster
of the 17th; but resigned in the Fall of '61, and was succeeded
by Lieut, (afterwards Capt.) <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>, who died at
Newbern in October, '62. Lieut. <span class="smcap">Dexter</span> succeeded, and is
the present incumbent.</p>

<p><i>Surgeon</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaac F. Galloupe.</span></p>

<p>[Dr. Galloupe is a hard-working, skillful, efficient and humane
man, and discharges his duty in a manner that commands the
respect and gratitude of every man who comes under his treatment.
The Dr. is from Lynn.]</p>

<p><i>Assistant Surgeon</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wm. H. W. Hinds</span>, of Boston.</p>

<p>[The men have no exalted opinion of this Dr.'s kindness or
capacity, though he seems attentive and a hard worker. Perhaps
his unpopularity arises from the fact that he unmercifully
doses all whom he considers 'bummers' (i. e., those who are too
lazy to do duty and 'play sick' to escape its performance) with
salts, jalap, blue pills, and especially quinine; but I think he
often punishes in this manner the deserving as well as the guilty.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Co. <i>A</i>&mdash;Capt. Henry Splaine, of Haverhill&mdash;was raised principally
in Newburyport.</p>

<p>Co. <i>B</i>&mdash;Capt Enoch F. Tompkins, of Haverhill (vice Capt.
S. C. Bancroft, S. Danvers, resigned)&mdash;South Danvers.</p>

<p>Co. <i>C</i>&mdash;Capt. Nehemiah P. Fuller&mdash;Danvers.</p>

<p>Co. <i>D</i>&mdash;Capt. Ivory N. Richardson, of Malden (Capt. Levi
Thompson, of Cambridge, deceased)&mdash;Salisbury and Amesbury.</p>

and Haverhill.</p>

Weir)&mdash;Lawrence.</p>

<p>Co. <i>K</i>&mdash;Capt. Joseph R. Simonds, of Melrose&mdash;Malden,
Medford and Saugus.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Recruiting for this regiment commenced as early as the fall
of Fort Sumter, but owing to the embarrassed condition of the
State, the hesitation of the General Government in regard to
accepting troops, and the want of authority on the part of the
Governor to act, this regiment was obliged to wait from week
to week without any decisive answer as to the intention of the
Government, concerning its organization. The companies were
formed on the militia basis, and were desirous of a regimental
organization, and to be mustered into the service, but every
effort which the company officers made in that direction, seemed
to be counteracted by the dominant political and monied influence
which was brought to bear in favor of other regimental
organizations, to the disparagement and detriment of the companies
comprising the 17th. While others were splendidly
provided for by private munificence, and hurried off to the seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of war, this regiment was unprovided by the State with an
organization, clothing, arms, equipments or rations. An opinion
prevailed at one time, that all idea of a regimental organization
must be given up, and the companies enter the United States
service, through some other State organization. Captains
Fuller of Danvers, and Day of Haverhill, determined on bringing
the matter to a focus.</p>

<p>"They visited the Governor, and after several ineffectual
efforts to get an audience, at length succeeded, and informed
His Excellency that they were going into the army, and should
take their commands with them; that they wanted to go in a
Massachusetts Regiment, and unless accepted by the State,
should go into the Mozart Regiment of New York, as one or
two other companies from Massachusetts had already done.
Orders were given them by the Governor to go into the camp
at Lynnfield. The other companies of which this regiment is
composed, were ordered to the same place, and all arrived there
between the 10th and 12th of July. They were mustered into
the United States service on the 22d, remained in camp until
the 23d of August, when they were ordered to Baltimore, and
arrived in that city on the 25th, at 4 o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The principal
duty of the regiment thus far, had been of a police character,
and it was moved about either as a whole or a part, from one
portion of the city to another, as circumstances required.</p>

<p>"Nov. 15, Co.'s F, K, E, G, H, and C, with Captain Nims'
Battery, were detailed to form a part of the brigade under command
of General Lockwood, for an expedition into the counties
of Accomac and Northampton, Va., for the purpose of breaking
up a rebel force concentrating there. The expedition went
on board a steam transport, and on the 17th arrived at Newtown.
Here they pitched their tents for the night, and the next
day marched a distance of sixteen miles into the country. The
rebels had felled trees across the roads in many places to obstruct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the advance of the troops, but they were cleared away
with but little delay. One deserted rebel battery, pierced for
four guns, was found on this day's march.</p>

<p>"On the 19th, the regiment reached Oak Hall, and on the 20th
the men went out fowling, and were very successful, taking a
large amount of game, which was dressed and partaken of by
the men with double relish, as they were on short rations of
hard bread and salt junk, and were much exhausted by the
fatigues of their march. On the 21st marched to Drummondtown,
a distance of twenty-seven miles, performing the journey
in eight hours, notwithstanding the many obstructions thrown
across the road by the rebels, and the burned bridges which
required them to march round, following the bend of the
streams. On this march, between Oak Hall and Drummondtown,
another rebel battery was discovered, pierced for fourteen
guns. The stars and stripes were at once raised over it, and three
rousing cheers given.</p>

<p>"November 23, took from the rebels seven guns, 150 small
arms, one barrel of powder, besides some swords, shot and shell.
At the jail were stored 8,000 rounds of cartridges and 200
small arms, which were also taken. Two gun-carriages and
one brass howitzer were also found secreted in the woods, and
captured. On the 26th, marched to Pongoteague, a distance of
twelve miles, and found another deserted battery.</p>

<p>"November 27th, marched from Pongoteague to Franktown, a
distance of twelve miles; and on the 28th, marched to Eastville,
thirteen miles, taking on the way one brass cannon, seven
horses, some small arms and swords, besides several other articles
contraband of war. The rebels had an unfinished earthwork
here which they deserted on the approach of the Federal
troops.</p>

<p>"A very large proportion of the arms and military stores captured
were returned by Gen. Lockwood to the parties claiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
them, creating great dissatisfaction among the troops, and
rendering the General liable to the suspicion that he sympathized
with the rebels.</p>

<p>"The object of the expedition having been attained, the
brigade was broken up, and the Mass. 17th embarked at Cherrystone
on the 1st and 2d of Dec., and sailed on the 4th for
Baltimore, where they arrived the same evening, and went into
their old quarters. On the 18th they commenced building barracks
[on Stewart's Place] for winter quarters and moved into
them on the 5th of January." (These barracks are still standing,
and used as a general hospital.)</p>

<p>In February Co.'s F and H relieved the 6th Michigan at
McKim's Place, and K and G the 4th Wisconsin at Patterson's
Park, those regt's being destined to form part of Gen. Butler's
force then about to sail for New Orleans. On the 14th of
March four other Co.'s of the 17th were ordered to Fort Marshall,
East Baltimore, to assist in defending that fortification
from an attack by rebel sympathizers, who, emboldened by the
destructive raid of the Merrimac in Hampton Roads, meditated
a rising in Baltimore, if not throughout the State.</p>

<p>When the 17th arrived in Baltimore they found the people
of that city nearly all 'secesh' in sentiment, and seeming only
constrained from rising by the presence in, and passage through,
the city, of large numbers of troops. It will then be readily
inferred that the men of this regiment had no very enviable
task to perform in endeavoring to keep the peace and making
these disaffected people see the evil of their ways. In doing
this, however, they were not fools enough to use moral suasion
alone&mdash;that would be casting pearls before swine&mdash;No; they
used arguments that were far more convincing, such as street
drills, practicing at street firing, &amp;c., all of which turned the
hate of the 'secesh' citizens into fear&mdash;and, finally, their fear
became a feeling of respect. What if the men were insulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
every time they walked the streets&mdash;the women (who were the
most outspoken) at length became weary of abusing them, and
the men who attempted to insult them never tried that game a
second time; for they found in the men of this regiment a spirit
that would brook no abuse&mdash;an indomitable, dare-devil disposition
that met them half way with a bowie knife as long and as
keen as their own, and a pistol as deadly. Thus they fought
their way to respect, and this latter feeling ripened into affection,
which is shown by the fact that when the regiment was
about to sail for North Carolina, the ladies of Baltimore presented
it with a magnificent silk flag, upon which was painted
a fine portrait of Washington.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March, '62, the regiment embarked at Baltimore
for Newbern, North Carolina, which place they reached
on the 1st of April, and encamped on a field to the west of the
city,&mdash;near where Fort Totten now stands, and which was
then in process of construction. On the 7th of April the regiment
was ordered out on picket duty&mdash;the left wing to Jackson's
place on the Trent road, and the right wing to a place
called the Red House on the Neuse road, relieving the 24th and
27th Mass. regt's. The regiment remained on picket until the
30th May, during which time they had frequent skirmishes with
the enemy, and made several raids and forays into the enemy's
country. Shortly after the regiment went to Jackson's place, a
few companies made a dash about nine miles up the Trent road
to a church, where they had a smart brush with the 'rebs,' two
of whom were killed and one wounded, and one taken prisoner.
It was here that one of those ludicrous incidents occurred which
often serve to relieve the dark outline of war's grim visage.
When the enemy were come up with, and firing became frequent,
Lt. Col. Fellows ordered the men to open right and left
to let the artillery pass to the front. One of the captains, mistaking
the full purport of the order, and thinking the ranks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to be opened to allow the rebels a fair field and an open road to
come into close quarters with his men, sang out:</p>

<p>"Open right and left, and let the d&mdash;d scallywags through!"</p>

<p>Captain Weir, of Co. I, with his command, and as many
volunteers as wished to accompany them, made a raid to Pollockville
to capture cotton, and anything else that might prove
of value to the "rebs" in their belligerent character. Now, as
this was not the first time Tom Weir (as he was familiarly
called) had invaded the sanctity of that village, the rebs had a
special eye to his movements, and lay in wait for him.</p>

<p>He had a mule team loaded with cotton, corn and other
plunder preceding him on his return, which the rebs in ambush
allowed to pass; but just as the company got opposite to where
they were concealed, they poured in a volley which killed three
and wounded the same number&mdash;and put the men into such a
panic that they fled. The captain stood, and endeavored to
rally them, but to no purpose, and he had to follow and leave
those who had fallen to their fate (which was being stripped of
arms, equipments, clothes, and whatever valuables they had
upon them), until rescued by the reinforcement which came up
promptly&mdash;to find the rebels flown. For this Captain Weir
was court-martialed, and dismissed the service&mdash;a sentence
which was universally condemned by the men, who considered
him a brave officer, having done all a man could do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Captain Lloyd of Company H, next tried his hand in
Pollocksville, but lost three men by the upsetting of a boat in
the Trent river on his outward march. He, however, took
some plunder and two prisoners.</p>

<p>The results of all these scouts and forays were the capture
of several thousand dollars' worth of cotton, corn, cattle, hens,
&amp;c., (there must have been <em>foul</em> play somewhere).</p>

<p>The regiment returned to Newbern on the 30th of May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and on the 26th of June were ordered to Swift Creek&mdash;upon
approaching the bridge leading across which they were
fired upon by the rebels (without sustaining any damage) who
had a battery masked by a breastwork or fort of shingles. The
17th charged across the bridge in fine style (the bridge was
a lightly built one, and swayed and shook under the combined
weight of 600 men in such a manner as to lead to the belief
that it would break down, but it didn't); but upon crossing they
found the enemy had flown. Three companies went up the
road in pursuit some distance, but the 'rebs' were nowhere to
be found. They halted near a dwelling house, when some of
the men went into an adjoining negro hut, where a pot of meat
and cabbage was in process of being cooked, which they proceeded
to confiscate; but just as they had commenced their
feast an officer came up and drove them off, saying:</p>

<p>"Dum thee, did thee coom here to ploonder."</p>

<p>At the same time, it was asserted, though I don't believe it,
that the officer who thus drove them from the feast had his pockets
filled with sweet potatoes and other "ploonder." Three
prisoners were taken. One of them a lad about 16 years
old, was thus interrogated by the Major:</p>

<p>"Vat for you be guerilla for?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a guerilla, sir; I'm in the regular Confederate
service."</p>

<p>"Vat for you lay in ambush, den?"</p>

<p>"I didn't lay in any bush, sir; I was standing behind a tree."</p>

<p>"Ha! You be von rascally guerilla, and we vill shtring you
up to a tree, ven we arrive in Newbern!"</p>

<p>But it is needless to say this threat was not carried out.</p>

<p>The reg't here received orders to rejoin the division (the 9th
army corps) which was about to leave the Department with
Gen. Burnside, and started of a Sunday morning 28th (without
breakfast) on their return. The weather was intensely hot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the sand on the road was ankle deep. The case, however, was
pressing, and the men were urged to their utmost; but the task
was too much for them,&mdash;and when the reg't arrived at the
landing about 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, after a march of 22 miles, it numbered
little more than a full company&mdash;the remaining 400 or 500
being distributed along the road for miles back. They, however,
kept coming in squads of from two to twenty during the
remaining part of the afternoon and evening&mdash;and a more tired
and thoroughly used up lot of men it would be difficult to find
anywhere. To make matters worse, when the reg't arrived at
the landing opposite Newbern, they found no transportation for
them, and nothing wherewith to satisfy the cravings of hunger.
It was not until about 12 o'clock at night that they received a
ration of hard bread and salt meat; but no vessels arrived to
transport them across, and they were forced to lay out upon the
sandy beach, without shelter, in a pelting, pitiless rain, which
had set in early in the evening. Next morning a couple of
scows or flat-boats arrived, and they were taken across; but
Gen. Burnside pitying their forlorn and used up condition, and
thinking it would be an act of cruelty to put men in such a state
on board transports, ordered the 6th New Hampshire reg't to
take their place. Thus the Seventeenth were cheated by fate
out of their share of the glory of South Mountain, Antietam,
Bull Run 2d, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Knoxville;
and were compelled to silently and doggedly face and fight
the most deadly of human foes in its own malarial fens and
swamps.</p>

<p>About the first of July the reg't was ordered to camp on the
south side of the Trent river near the county bridge, to do
picket and outpost duty, which consisted of sending a company
to Bray's Ferry and plantation about three miles out, and
another to Evans' Mills&mdash;seven miles down the railroad towards
Beaufort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>About July 25th the regiment went in an expedition to Pollocksville,
and constructed a bridge across the Trent river for
the entire column to cross upon, after reaching which place,
Col. Amory, who was in command, decided to push on to Trenton;
but upon approaching to within four miles of the latter
place he found the enemy too strong, and withdrew without
bringing on an engagement.</p>

<p>August 20th, six companies of the 17th went to Swift Creek,
again, accompanied by a section of the New York Marine Artillery
and four boat howitzers. Lt. Col. Fellows, who was in
command of the expedition, having missed the boat that conveyed
the reg't and artillery across the river, the command
devolved upon the Major, who marched them about a mile from
the landing, and halted to await the Colonel's coming. The
column halted opposite a dwelling, and, as is often the case
under like circumstances, there was a rush for the well to fill
canteens. Two of the men, however, strayed into a field and
were making a flank movement upon a pile of tumble-down log
outbuildings, supposed to abound in hens, chickens, eggs, &amp;c.
One of these men, a very tall and large specimen of humanity
was named Gilman; the other was a small man, and, for my
purpose, nameless. The vigilant Major detected this unauthorized
flanking affair, and, being determined to put a stop to all such
unmilitary proceedings, sung out:</p>

<p>"Vat for you shtray off dat way? Come back, I say to you!
Dou-bel <em>twit</em>!" (quick)</p>

<p>The little man obeyed, and came back at a dog-trot. Gilman,
however, hastened back slowly&mdash;at much too slow a gait to suit
his impatient superior, who yelled out again:</p>

<p>"Dou-bel twit!&mdash;I say&mdash;dou-<em>bel</em> <span class="smcap">TWIT</span>!"</p>

<p>But no faster came Gilman on, and the Major (who was a
little man) rushed to him, and seizing him by the coat collar as
he was crossing a fence, dragged him over,&mdash;then, drawing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sword and flourishing it about the head of the still doggedly
defiant Gilman, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You tink, because I am small, I'm be afraid of you? I will
let you know! Dou-bel twit! now, or I will make two Gilman
of you!"</p>

<p>There was a man called Tom Croke in Co. E&mdash;an extremely
hard ticket&mdash;quarrelsome, venomous, and altogether thoroughly
depraved. He had been a source of trouble and annoyance to
the officers of the company ever since he came into it. On this
expedition, I believe, he shot the top of one of his fingers off&mdash;an
accident, as he told the captain (McNamara)&mdash;</p>

<p>"Devil d&mdash;n you," replied the latter, "it's a pity it wasn't
your head!"</p>

<p>Tom Croke, for this or some other misdemeanor, was subsequently
court-martialed and sent to Fort Macon to serve out his
time, from which place he escaped to the rebels. On his way
from the Fort to rebeldom he met a deserter coming into our
lines, whom he directed as to the best route to pursue, and who
in turn gave him such information as he desired to facilitate his
escape.</p>

<p>When the expedition arrived at the bridge over Swift Creek
it was evening. Our cavalry, which had preceded them, were
bivouacked for the night on the other side, and our men at
first took them to be rebels, but were soon undeceived.</p>

<p>There was a store-house in the village of Swift Creek, containing
a variety of articles in the dry goods, grocery and
merchandise line. Some of the boys smelt the plunder, and
proceeded to confiscate. The wife of the owner of the store
suspecting what was going on, went to Col. Fellows and told
him the men were breaking in, and he immediately repaired to
the scene of operations to put a stop to such work. A member
of Co. K, who had been left on the watch, gave warning of the
colonel's approach, and the raiders hid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"What ho! there,&mdash;what does all this mean? What are you
doing here?" (To Co. K man.)</p>

<p>"I'm on guard, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, madam," said the colonel; "you see there is a
guard on."</p>

<p>What plunder the boys obtained it would be bootless to
relate.</p>

<p>The expedition returned to Newbern, burning the bridge
after them.</p>

<p>The camp of the 17th was situated in what was formerly a
cotton field, on the banks of the river Trent, affording excellent
facilities for washing clothes and bathing, of which most of the
men availed themselves,&mdash;and at all hours of the day men could
be seen bathing in the river, or squatted along its margin washing
clothes. It seemed at first sight to one unacquainted with
the peculiarities of the climate, to be a well chosen and healthy
location (and indeed it was about the best in the vicinity); but
the hanging mosses that everywhere shrouded the few solitary
cedars which still survived the ravages of the pioneer's axe,
showed the unmistakeable presence of fever and ague&mdash;that
pest of new and warm countries. About a couple of hundred
yards up the river, close to the county bridge, a fort was in
process of completion,&mdash;the work of 'contrabands,' numbers of
whom I observed busily employed in and around it. Beyond
this were encamped some light batteries; while still further on,
and at the crossing of a deep, sluggish stream called Brice's
Creek, a number of detailed men were at work constructing a
block-house (a square-built fort, made of hewn logs, compactly
put together&mdash;and most conveniently constructed to be knocked
to pieces by a six-pounder about a poor devil's ears). Between
the artillery camp and the block-house was a brick dwelling-house,
once the property of Gov. Speight, the late owner and
family of which fled after the battle of Newbern. This house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was afterwards demolished to supply bricks for chimneys of
barracks built near by in the Fall. To the rear of this house,
about 75 yards distant, beautifully shaded by fine old trees, was
the tomb of Gen. Speight, a revolutionary hero, and one of the
early Governors of North Carolina.</p>

<p>The plain on which the 17th were encamped is about two
and a half miles long, and from one-half to two miles wide, and
had, evidently, before the rude hand of war obliterated their
boundaries and landmarks, consisted of two or three plantations.
This plain was an excellent place for drilling, and nearly all
reviews were held there.</p>

<p>The whole field gave evidence of having, at different times
and in different parts, been camped upon by infantry, artillery,
and cavalry&mdash;and everywhere evidences of military occupation
were visible in the shape of broken bottles, dilapidated canteens,
dippers and plates, and remnants of worn-out shoes, coats,
blouses, pants, and harness, forgotten tent-stakes, sink holes and
caved-in wells. While overhead and around, unnoticed and
unmolested, on lazy wing sailed the huge turkey-buzzard, scenting
the dead carcase and decayed garbage from afar, and
patiently biding the absence of man from its vicinity ere he
descended to gorge himself therewith.</p>

<p>I noticed a great variety of wild flowers in the fields, some of
which were very beautiful. A species of cactus grows wild
here; but is a very inferior kind. Wild garlic is also to be met
with everywhere. A coarse grass, called Bear's grass, grows in
bunches here, the leaves of which, when subjected to a roasting
process in hot ashes, are uncommonly strong, and take the place
of small ropes and cords with the natives, who apply it in a
variety of ways, from the suspension of a dead pig to the tying
of a shoe, or temporarily supplying the place of a lost button.
From the centre of these bunches of Bears grass a stem five or
six feet high shoots up in the spring-time, which is crowned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a crest of yellow flowers very beautiful to behold at a distance.</p>

<p>A few days' experience of camp-life gave me a better knowledge
of its comforts and discomforts, its tribulations and my
philosophy. It was the middle of August, and the weather very
warm. The first night of my abode in my new quarters was
undisturbed from any cause, from the fact that I was tired after
the sea-voyage. But the second night I was destined to feel
some of the annoyances to be endured by campaigners in warm
climates. Mosquitoes revel in this congenial atmosphere, as do
also the blue-tail fly, and a species of biting insect like the common
house-fly, while gallinippers, gnats, ants, and biting sand-fleas,
(which play second fiddle to the old-fashioned iron-clad
chaps, their bites making one squirm as if twinged by a bad conscience,)
and grey-backs, all attack the hapless sleeper in
succession, in a body, by detail, in squads, battalion,&mdash;in brigades
drawn up in echelon&mdash;in front, flank and rear. They scale the
walls of his fortress in the very teeth of a fierce cannonade of
imprecations&mdash;burst the barriers of bedclothes&mdash;penetrate the
abatti of woolen socks and tightly-tied drawers&mdash;and though,
even after gaining the inside of your works, they are subjected
to a deadly cross-fire of small arms, yet they invariably "attain
the object of their reconnoissance." The bayonet is powerless
against them, and they never draw off from the attack till fairly
exhausted with the feast of blood.</p>

<p>What surprised me most was the utter indifference manifested
by the veterans to the petty annoyance of vermin and insects,
and the matter-of-fact way in which they overhauled their clothing
and disposed of the grey-backs when found.</p>

<p>For about a week the recruits had "fine times," as the soldiers
thought, having nothing to do but "bum around," and sleep&mdash;when
they could, which was mostly in the day time. The days
were excessively hot, as were the nights until about 11 or 12
o'clock, when it became uncomfortably cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>During this week of leisure, I pretty thoroughly explored the
region in the vicinity of our camp, and visited Newbern on
'pass,' but found nothing special there to note, if I may except
the fact that there were many really cozy and comfortable-looking
dwellings, and numerous flower and fruit gardens&mdash;some
of which gave evidences of former tasteful ownership, but which
seemed of late to have come in for their share of the general
neglect and destruction. Those of the inhabitants who still
clung to their homes seemed to wear a sullen and discontented
look, with some exceptions, and these were of the mercantile
class, who, with the sutlers and others who follow the wake of
armies, seemed to fall in for their fair proportion of the trade.</p>

<p>About the greatest curiosity to me was what was called the
new cemetery, in the upper section or suburb of the city,&mdash;the
wall enclosing which is built of shell-rock&mdash;a curious fossil concrete
obtained in some part of the State&mdash;where I do not know.
There are many graves, and a few tasteful tombstones. Beyond
this in what has become an open field or common, are
several soldiers' graveyards consecrated by the poor fellows
whose bodies repose there, who for love of fatherland, left home
and kindred to return no more.</p>

<p>My first duty on picket was at Mr. Bray's plantation. "Old
Bray" the boys called him, and being on the outpost which was
near his house, I determined to give the old gentleman a call. I
found Mr. and Mrs. Bray at home, the former seated on the
piazza reading a newspaper, and the latter squatted on the doorstep
doing 'nothing in particular.' They were a lean pair, (but
their <i>leaniny</i> was not on our side, as I afterwards found), and
had a family of five or six lean boys and girls. They certainly
looked an unromantic enough realization of our ideal Southern
planter and his family. Mr. Bray was apparently about 45 years
of age, and his wife perhaps as old, although she seemed much
older. They both looked sour and cross enough to dispense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with the use of vinegar at meal-time. But they did not seem
indisposed to have a chat with the Yankee 'hirelings,' and
soon I was made acquainted with all their griefs&mdash;the husband
commencing the relation of them, but the wife invariably winding
up.</p>

<p>I then for the first time learnt how this benevolent planter and
his amiable wife had been abused&mdash;how, first of all, notwithstanding
a 'protection' from Gen. Burnside, their 'niggers' had
been enticed away, all efforts to get them back proving fruitless,
owing to the "abolition officers and soldiers."</p>

<p>"Niggers and pigs were the only things that ever paid any
ways well," put in Mrs. Bray.</p>

<p>They had only five pigs and three 'niggers' left now, and did
not know how soon they'd go off with the rest.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers who had been on picket near their
plantation had behaved very bad, and had stolen and destroyed
much of their corn and all their water melons (melancholy to
relate); and Co. K of the 17th, was the worst of the lot&mdash;and
the lady wound up with the expression of a hope "that the
new recruits would be more of gentlemen than the old soldiers,
and not seek to injure her as they had done."</p>

<p>Mr. Bray then showed me his melon patch which, though
evincing some traces of the recent vandal act, still bore a goodly
number, which I made a note of. He also showed me a patch
of cotton, in full bloom,&mdash;and after another hour of desultory
conversation, I left with the impression that old Bray was a
'great man on a small scale,' but his wife was the greater of
the two.</p>

<p>About September 1st a storm came on, accompanied by rain,
which lasted that and the following day and night, giving us and
our traps a thorough soaking. During all this time I did not
sleep a wink. The third morning, wet, sleepless and weary, I
was detailed for guard, and was put on the third relief (from 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and 1 to 3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>), and during the first two hours of my
guard was refreshed by a 'jolly' shower of rain, which came in
at my coat collar and soon filled and overflowed my boots.</p>

<p>When the third relief turned in for the night, I lay down
with the rest, on the wet ground, and attempted to sleep; but it
was no go&mdash;so, lighting my pipe (sole comforter at times), I left
the tent, and sat under a tree near by, and smoked the hours
away (rain or no rain) until the third relief fell in, when taking
my musket and falling in to my place, I was soon on my post,
which extended from a tree (blown over by the wind) to the
river bank, about 85 paces distant. I felt drowsy, but paced
my beat rapidly to keep awake, until tired out, I leaned against
the inclined trunk of the fallen tree to rest awhile. My brain
was in a whirl, and everything about me seemed to reel and
oscillate unsteadily. It was moonlight, but cloudy. More than
once I thought I detected myself napping, and shook myself,
and pinched my nose and ears to keep awake. My comrade,
whose beat joined mine, came up occasionally, and we exchanged
a few words. I exhorted him if he caught me napping to rouse
me. He had left me, and was near the other end of his beat,
when, on looking after him, I beheld, about ten paces from me,
as plainly as if in daylight, the form of a huge negro. He wore
a broad-brimmed hat, a linen coat blue or <i>dark</i> striped, vest,
white shirt (seemingly of cotton,) open at the neck, around
which was a colored handkerchief tied sailor fashion, the ends
hanging down loose. His pants seemed of light fabric, checked.
I could see his countenance plainly. It seemed, if anything,
smiling, though there was something peculiar in its expression,
as well as the attitude, for the figure seemed leaning its weight
on one foot, its left hand resting on the hip, and the right arm
hanging loosely by its side. The expression of the darky was
so peculiar&mdash;jaunty, saucy&mdash;and he looked full at me, that for a
moment I was taken by surprise,&mdash;and, during that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
made the observations just recorded&mdash;but quickly recovering, I
brought my piece to 'charge,' and called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who comes there?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" width="600" height="393" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But no response was deigned by my darky visitor. I challenged
again, and again, with the same result, the object still
retaining its position, and regarding me with the same complacent
look&mdash;when my comrade, who heard my first challenge
came up, and inquired what the matter was, just as I was about
bringing my piece to 'present' to fire. I pointed to the object
of my challenging, who still kept his ground in the same position.
He laughed at what he supposed was a joke I was trying to
come on him&mdash;not being able to see anything in the spot I
pointed out,&mdash;and resumed his beat. The thought then occurred
to me for the first time that what I saw was not real. What
then was it? I asked myself. Surely I am not troubled with
that disease known as 'nigger on the brain!' And I again
leaned against the trunk of the fallen tree to think the subject
over, all the while keeping my eyes fixed upon the object of my
thoughts, which stood the scrutiny unmoved. Now, I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
superstition by nature, and still less so by education and experience,&mdash;and
so I viewed the apparition without a particle of
fear or awe, and tried to account to myself for its appearance in
the most natural and rational manner. I came to the conclusion
there and then, that want of rest and the stimulation of
the coffee and tobacco I had been indulging in unduly excited
my brain, which produced the hallucination, on the same principle
that it is produced in certain stages of drunkenness, called
delirium tremens. This was a very fair deduction; but still
in front of me stood the grinning darky, as plainly as before. I
thought then I would test the unreality of the apparition in
another way. If it were an optical illusion, the figure must
recede as I advanced, or follow as I retreated. I accordingly
advanced towards it; but, strange to say, it remained in the
same spot, until I was within arm's length, when stretching forth
my hand I grasped&mdash;nothing. I walked over the exact spot
where the figure stood, and returned to my old stand, to be still
more puzzled to see the figure in the same spot, with the same
expression on its countenance, but with <em>both</em> arms hanging down
by its side this time. More puzzled still, I retreated to see if it
would follow; but no&mdash;there it stood still gazing after me. I
took three or four turns up and down my beat, and on each
return to the fallen tree beheld the figure in the same position
as last seen. I then halted, determined to watch if other changes
would manifest themselves in shadowy being before me. My
comrade came towards me again, and I reiterated my former
tale of the apparition. Still he couldn't see it. But, as I was
yet talking of it, and still persisting I saw it, the phantom darky
disappeared&mdash;not suddenly, but seeming to melt away gradually.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He vanished in the darkness, like a beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cold, gray moonlight in a wintry stream."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the first and only ghost I have ever had the pleasure
of seeing, or, more properly speaking, fancying I saw. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
caused its appearance I neither know nor care, and only relate
the fact (or fancy) because I think it singular.</p>

<p>On a Sunday morning, about 10 o'clock, we started for
Evans' Mills, to relieve Co. E, which had overstayed their time
one week&mdash;doubtless from the fact that a large orchard of apple
trees was upon the plantation, the fruit of which was a luxury
they were loth to leave&mdash;small blame to them.</p>

<p>After a march of about two hours, we came out upon a clearing
just beyond a continuation of the rebel line of defences to
the right of the Beaufort railroad. Here we saw deserted houses,
and a cotton gin; but no living creature of the human or brute
creation, and the place looked solitary and deserted enough&mdash;its
own sad elegy of war written plainly in the solitude which
brooded over the absence of those who once gave animation to
the scene, and made 'the wilderness blossom like the rose'
with fields of cotton and gardens of bright flowers.</p>

<p>About a mile further on, after passing through a narrow
belt of woods, we came out upon Evans' plantation. On our
right was a field of some eighty acres, about half of which was
covered with a young growth of apple trees. On the left was a
field of about twenty acres, at the further end of which was the
plantation house, with its negro huts, surrounded with the inevitable
grove of elegant shade trees. Just opposite the front gate
of the mansion, the road turned sharp to the right, and on looking
ahead, we beheld a block-house, nearly completed, in the
rear of which was the encampment, and our future abode.
Upon reaching the block-house, the road took a turn to the left,
down a short, steep hill, skirting the bank of a stream, which
it crossed on a rude plank bridge, still turning toward the left.
After crossing the bridge, a grist mill lay on the right, and about
60 yards on the left, on the dam of a magnificent pond of water
stood a large saw mill, which ran two sets of saws when in operation.
It was then idle, the dam having broke away. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
road, after crossing the flume of the grist mill led on to the
negro village&mdash;quite a collection of comfortable houses&mdash;built on
each side of the cross road, which led to Pollocksville. Just
before coming on to the Pollocksville road, in a field to the right
was a large cotton gin and press. At the intersection of these
roads was our outpost in the day time, the guard being drawn
in to the mills at night.</p>

<p>The army wagons which accompanied, (with tents, cooking
utensils, quartermasters' stores, company baggage, &amp;c.,) arriving
a few minutes after, the men soon had plenty to do in erecting
tents, and fixing themselves as comfortably as circumstances
would permit. There was a little board shanty with two bunks,
lately occupied by the drummers of Co. E. To this my comrade
and I 'froze'; and, having got our traps snugly bestowed&mdash;our
guns and equipments slung up, and our blankets spread&mdash;we
sallied forth in quest of plunder.</p>

<p>Our first raid was upon the orchard near by; but it had been
picked bare. We, however, subjected every tree to a searching
examination, and as the reward of our toil returned with about
half a bushel of a apples. On our way back we passed through
a small field of sweet potatoes, to which we returned with a
sack, and soon were in possession of a bushel of very fine ones.</p>

<p>During our absence, foraging, the tents had all been put up,
and the men were busy arranging their traps. Charley (our
French cook) had not been idle meantime, and had a blazing
fire, and coffee ready. Procuring from him a pot, we soon had
the satisfaction of seeing some of the sweet potatoes, the fruits of
our late raid, smiling upon us, and welcoming us to the feast.
Giving the cook a couple of good ones for his accommodation,
we retired to our cabin with our coffee, sweet potatoes and 'salt
horse,' and made one of the most hearty and satisfactory meals
I have ever known. Appetite was our best sauce, exercise had
sharpened it, and the new and palatable food agreed so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with the disposition of the stomach, that it had ample satisfaction
in embracing its best friend.</p>

<p>After eating, with pipe lit, I started forth to take a view of
the mansion house, and its surroundings. On entering the front
gate, I was struck with the size and beauty of an immense beech
tree, whose wide extending branches covered a circle of over
100 feet in diameter&mdash;and, Yankee fashion, I immediately computed
that if cut down it would make over five cords of firewood.
It must have proved a cool and inviting shade for the
planter and his family in the summer time. Approaching its
huge trunk, I observed that the Yankee jacknife had been at
work and covered it with the representative names of men from
nearly every United States regiment that had ever been
in the department. Besides the huge beech there were numerous
other trees&mdash;elm, cedar, chaney&mdash;and the beautiful flowering
althea.</p>

<p>The house was an ordinary two story one, containing about 7
rooms, set on brick blocks about three feet from the ground,
and serving as a cool place of resort for the pigs, fowl, and
youthful, curly-headed negroes, during the heat of the day.
This, together with the plantation attached of some 10,000 acres,
seven or eight hundred of which were cleared, together with the
mills, and about 120 'head of darkies' (all of which excepting
two old negroes and their wives, had been 'run up country'),
belonged to a Mr. Evans, a son-in-law of Ex-Gov. Morehead,
(after whom Morehead city had been named).</p>

<p>Evans was, as I afterwards found, a very influential man in
that part of the country, and had early become a convert to the
doctrine of secession. He raised a company of cavalry, and
equipped them at his own expense. He took part in the battle
of Newbern, and it must have been a bitter trial for him to
leave so fine a property, though I believe he had another plantation
in the upper part of the State. The regiment to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his company was attached, remained for some time in the
State, and had more than one encounter with our cavalry.
They were, however, finally ordered to join the army of Virginia,
and were, no doubt, engaged in all its conflicts with our
army. At the battle of Gettysburg, Evans, who had become a
colonel, was wounded, taken prisoner, and died shortly after in
hospital at Baltimore.</p>

<p>Such has been the fate of an infatuated man, who, like thousands
of others, left a prosperous and comfortable home to plunge
in the suicidal fray against the Government under which he was
reared and had prospered. He may have repented his folly
when too late; but I doubt it. Such men are as little given to
repentance as they are to truth, justice and reason.</p>

<p>At the back of the mansion house were two negro huts, where
those who were domestics lodged. The body of the negroes
were lodged in the village before mentioned about a mile away.
Doubtless there was design in this&mdash;as the master of bondmen
must have lived as insecure amongst his slaves as the tyrant
in the midst of his vassals.</p>

<p>Adjoining the negro-huts attached to the mansion were the
various outhouses and stables, behind which the land sloped to
waters of the tortuous stream which emptied into the mill-pond
further down.</p>

<p>To my view Evans' Mills at first appeared a lonely place;
but a further acquaintance with it materially altered my opinion.
Were it not that the restraints which discipline imposes upon the
soldier, living in this place would be quite agreeable. There
was no lack of game of all kinds, from the red deer, the nocturnally
rambling coon and possum, to the partridge, wild pigeons,
grouse, waterfowl, and fish. The latter were the only legitimate
sport for the soldiers (and many a finny inhabitant of those
sluggish streams&mdash;though shy at times&mdash;graced his tin platter),
as the necessities of war forbid the use of fire-arms upon any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
other game than men (butternuts&mdash;and some of them mighty
hard nuts at that). Occasionally, however, the negroes, and
such of the white inhabitants as were left behind 'when the
rush of war was past,' with their coon dogs, and well provided
with pine knots to guide them, would sally forth of a night and
traverse the banks of the numerous streams and branches,
and rarely would they proceed far until the peculiar bay of
the dogs denoted that they had lit upon the track of a wary
possum or coon, in the direction of which the hunters would
hasten, to find the 'critter treed,' and if the tree was too large
to cut down, one climbed, and with a club killed or dislodged
him. A coon hunt has rarely been unsuccessful, from the great
number of the 'animals' abounding, and the excellent training
of the dogs, which seem to take after this kind of game as naturally
as a cat takes after mice.</p>

<p>The streams are generally belted with fine groves of cedar,
gum, black walnut, locust, and ash trees, intermixed, the whole
bearing their proportion of parasites, some of which entwine
themselves so closely round the trees they select to climb on as
almost to become incorporated with them in the process of time,
and look like huge serpents endeavoring to crush out their life
but they look beautiful in the summer time, covered with leaves
and fruit (for they are not all poisonous or profitless), and many
a bunch of rich, purple grapes has the writer purloined from
the midst of those masses of tangled creepers. This intermingling
of hardwood trees with the evergreen pines had a pleasing
effect upon me, as it recalled the remembrance of the northern
forests where the pine, hemlock and spruce were often in the
minority.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the explorer of these Southern woods,
would suddenly come upon a cypress swamp, and he would
there behold the incarnation of all that is dismal in a landscape,&mdash;especially
if, as when I first beheld one, the time was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
before twilight, and the slanting rays of the sun had ceased to
penetrate the masses of the forest foliage. A picture, however
finely wrought, would fail to give an idea of the utter gloom and
funereal solemnity of such a scene; and if any lover or hater of
humanity should wish to seek a solitude where, unmolested, he
could mourn over the wickedness and folly of mankind, and
make himself thoroughly miserable, I would advise him to select
a spot in full view of a cypress swamp,&mdash;and if he will not
suffer enough, do enough penance, and weep enough to wash out
and atone for the world's sins&mdash;his own included,&mdash;in the space
of the twelve months, then it will not be the fault of the swamp,
I can vouch. I do not wonder that the ancients, even aside
from their superstitions, selected the cypress as an emblem of
death and mourning&mdash;for no one can behold that tree in its native
solitude and state without thinking of all the friends he had
lost, and would be likely to lose for the next hundred years.&mdash;Picture
to yourself, gentle reader, the bed of a sluggish stream,
enriched by the accumulations of vegetable mould for unknown
ages, until the water forced itself through a deep, narrow channel,
winding hither and thither; that at a former indefinite
period, the seeds deposited on this mould germinated, and there
arose from its slimy depths, like ghosts that had 'burst their cerements,'
the mighty cypress trees; that they continued to grow
slowly upward, but toward the base the trunks swelled to undue
proportions like the paunches of gluttons&mdash;and undoubtedly the
cypress is the glutton among trees, as its huge cone-shaped roots
are well adapted to the ravenous absorption of air, and the rich
liquified food that is forever in process of formation around and
above them. And thus they tower up in the midst of their
slimy abode, huge, bilious and bloated, and look like a grim
array of fallen spirits, which, having attempted to cross into
daylight, got stuck in the mud of their mythical Styx.</p>

<p>Such is a cypress swamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In nationality the men of Co. K comprised Americans, Canadians,
Provincials, English, Irish, Scotch, French and Germans.
In disposition and character, they were nearly as diverse as
their nationality; but taken as specimens of the countries they
represented, were about as intelligent and respectable a body of
men as could well be expected from such material.</p>

<p>The Captain, Joseph R. Simonds, (for many years a bookbinder
in Spring Lane, Boston,) was a thoroughly patriotic and
honest man, a good soldier, with many virtues, and a few faults
and foibles (and what man has not these to a greater or less extent.)
He took great pride in the well-being and efficiency of
his company; and its good name, and the praise of his superiors
for cleanliness, superiority in drill, or having a small sick-list,
were to him matters of just pride and gratulation,&mdash;and frequently,
after a creditable performance on drill or parade, he
would snap his fingers with delight, and, after dismissal, invite
them all to his quarters for a treat. He was careful about the
quality of their food, and whenever he could (which was not
often) would procure such articles of luxury and dietic change
as would be most likely to promote health. He was uniformly
kind, obliging and considerate, and did not look upon his men
as mere pieces of mechanism that moved when he pulled the
wires. He considered them <em>men</em>,&mdash;socially his equals, though in
reality under his command, and, to a certain extent at his mercy.
He rarely abused his authority&mdash;never maliciously; and though
he occasionally did injustice to some deserving men&mdash;it was, I
think, more from an error of judgment than through design.
Yet he was popular and unpopular with the men. Soldiers
like sailors will grumble, and it is a privilege they often abuse;
but, the fit over, they all invariably acknowledged his worth,
and disposition to treat them well.</p>

<p>The first Lieut (J. A. Greeley) was of a quiet disposition, a
strict (but not over strict) disciplinarian, and a man of considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
genius in engineering (he subsequently had the planning
and superintendence of several fortifications near Newbern).
He was a strict temperance man, and wished the men to practice
this virtue also. He has since been detached from the regiment,
and commissioned captain in the 2d regiment of Heavy
Artillery.</p>

<p>But I cannot enumerate the names of all the company,&mdash;and
will content myself with mentioning a few of the 'characters'&mdash;and
the first that occurs to my mind is "old Jesse Hitchings"
(forgive me, Jesse, for putting your name in print; but you
need be no more ashamed of it than you were of your old cap
riddled by the enemy's bullets). Jesse was a character&mdash;a tall,
thin old bachelor of over fifty&mdash;of a pleasant, benevolent disposition,
a good soldier, an uncompromising patriot (no com<em>promises</em>
with the rebels, was his motto)&mdash;and a successful hand at
poker. It is related of Jesse, that when the company was doing
picket duty at the Deep Gully, he lit a fire one night at the
outpost, and when his time came to mount guard, leisurely
walked up and down in front of the fire, giving the enemy's
pickets a fair chance, if so disposed, to pick him off&mdash;and upon
being warned of his danger, coolly replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, if I'm to be shot I'll be shot, I suppose&mdash;what's the
odds."</p>

<p>In camp, on guard, in the bivouac of the battle-field, wherever
there was a fire, Jesse could be seen at any hour of the
night bending over the same, his chin resting between his knees,
warming his long skinny hands&mdash;sometimes asleep; but mostly
half awake or dozing. Poor Jesse&mdash;he is one of the few sterling
men who act well their part without ostentation, and are rarely
noticed for their real worth.</p>

<p>Another character was "Billy Patterson" (he was called
"Billy," though his name was James). He was a hard-working,
rough-spoken fellow (his general salutation being "G' along till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
haal wi' ye!") Billy, though a good soldier, and brave in action,
did not like guard or picket duty&mdash;and, being an excellent
cook, generally contrived by a species of finesse&mdash;not always of
an unexceptionable character&mdash;to work himself into a good
berth, with pots for his jolly companions. Charley (our French
cook) shortly after going to Evans' Mills fell sick, and Billy
took his place&mdash;which he held afterwards for a long time, and
flourished and bullied when sober, and when drunk abused
every one&mdash;and gave the mess very good dinners.</p>

<p>Sam Kenny was another whom I considered a character. He
was nicknamed 'Dickens,' being a great admirer of that author.
'Dickens' was an intelligent man, but fond of whiskey; and
whenever he imbibed too much was sure to get in to some scrape
or other, which generally ended in depositing him in the guardhouse.
It is related of him, that being one night in Newbern,
on a 'bender,' he applied for admission into a house (where he
was acquainted), but the lady noticing his condition, refused;
when, after repeated failures to get in, becoming convinced
of the uselessness of any further trial, and by way of revenge,
he put his mouth to the keyhole, and shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, madam, do you chew snuff?"</p>

<p>Now be it known that snuff chewing is quite a common practice
among the women in and around Newbern, and for aught I
know is a regular Southern institution; but those of any pretension
to refinement never use it, or if they do, it is on the sly&mdash;and
a greater insult could not be offered a woman than to ask
her if she chewed snuff. 'Dickens,' no doubt, had his revenge.</p>

<p>A young fellow, named J. E. Mills, had a mania for cutting
his autograph upon trees, walls, fences, and objects in every
place he visited. It is related that during a freshet, when a lot
of logs in the river above the dam broke loose, every one of
them contained one or more inscriptions of "J. E. M.," cut in
with an axe or knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>William Stack 'was a soldier every inch of him.' He had
been in the British service over ten years, and served in India.
His peculiarities were numerous; but were redeemed by a strict
integrity, a love of duty and a thorough knowledge of his business.
I often wondered why men, his inferiors in many of the
most essential qualifications of a soldier, were promoted over
him, while he remained a private. He entertained a great veneration
for the British army&mdash;and thought the British soldier not
only superior, but better paid, better clothed, and better cared
for than the American soldier. He had a good memory, a rich
fund of anecdote, and many a weary hour has he beguiled by
the relation of scenes and adventures in 'the land of the palm
and the poppy.'</p>

<p>John Smith was another who had served in the British army.
He was a good soldier, an unpretending man, and the pertinacity
with which he defended the government, (there are two
parties in the army as well as here), his strong anti-slavery sentiments
when nearly all were down on the poor negro, and the
confidence he felt in the ultimate success of our cause, even in
the darkest hours when the general opinion prevailed that we
could never whip the South, might well put to shame many of
his American comrades, who often seemed to lose in their desire
for peace, the consciousness that it was theirs to dictate the
terms to a beaten foe. The poor fellow has been taken prisoner&mdash;and
is now in Dixie.</p>

<p>Smith had a brother who was nicknamed 'Ben-Doza.' 'Ben'
was discharged in March, 1863, and I gave him a curious stick
which I cut in one of the swamps to bring home for me. If this
should meet his eye, I wish he would hasten to 'fork it over.'</p>

<p>But lest I should become tedious and uninteresting, I will
drop the biographical and take up the chronological thread of
my yarn, noticing the different individuals as they may be
brought by circumstances into future scenes. It is true that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
speaking of the mere rank and file of the army, I do not write
of men known to fame. There is, indeed, little of romance
connected with the private soldier&mdash;that peculiar species of
flummery (which makes the heart of the dreamy damsel of sixteen
flutter so) being, as it were by right divine, the speciality
of the ideal mustached, lightning-eyed, and so forth young
men of the shoulder straps. Those I write of principally
occupy, many of them, the humblest (though the most useful)
position in our grand army. It is such men who do the real
fighting, and have to take and give the hardest knocks&mdash;and
if a score of those brave hearts are laid low by the hand of war,
it creates not half as much public sensation as the destruction of
an old barn by fire, or the escape of a negro from rebeldom.
Their biography is written by the orderly sergeant in a few
words, and their requiem sung by the turkey-buzzard out on a
foraging expedition. Their names, it is true, are on the rolls of
fame; but who cares for these, except it be their immediate
friends and relatives&mdash;and the clerks in the pension-bureau, who
mayhap think it particularly unkind in privates A. B. or C. to
die at all, and thus give them so much additional labor.</p>

<p>Two brothers, named Tibbetts, living about three miles beyond
our outpost, lost some hogs and cattle in a very mysterious way,
and came into our lines to inquire if we knew anything of them.
Of course we didn't, and Billy Patterson's pots never told tales.
I entered into conversation with one of the brothers, who appeared
to be a civil sort of a man, and who invited me among
others to visit his house, saying that he had plenty of eggs, &amp;c.,
and could get up a very good dinner for us.</p>

<p>I remembered Tibbetts' invitation, and a few days after, accompanied
by a companion, started out to see him. He lived in
a miserable log cabin, about 20 feet square, without windows,
having shutters to supply their place at night, which were
opened in the day time to admit light and air. A field of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
25 acres surrounded the domicile, partly planted in corn and
peas, with about three acres of sweet potatoes. And these, with
a few pigs, and a small garden, constituted this family's whole
'visible means of support.' The family consisted of a sallow,
bilious-looking wife (all women thereabouts, as well as men, look
alike) and a half-dozen sallow, bilious-looking children. (Nearly
all the natives of that level, swampy region are thin, and have
a shaky appearance.)</p>

<p>I noticed, to my surprise, upon my first introduction to
Madam Tibbetts, that a small stick protruded about two inches
from her mouth, and that ever and anon she spat out what
seemed marvellously like tobacco juice. I watched her movements
for some time during our conversation, and I noticed that
she occasionally removed the stick from her mouth, and, one end
being made soft by chewing, dipped the same into a box of snuff,
replaced it again, and ran it around her gums and teeth in
the same manner as one would use a tooth-brush. I found that
neither Tibbetts or his wife, nor his brother or sister (the latter
a smiling old maid) who afterwards joined us, could read or
write&mdash;in fact it was considered quite out of their line altogether,
though they seemed to regret that their children could
not have some education. They were a fair specimen of that
class of settlers at the South known as 'poor whites.'</p>

<p>Being allowed, when off duty, a free range within the lines,
our visits were made in all directions&mdash;sometimes (often, I confess)
transgressing our orders, we went beyond, especially
towards the abodes of the Messrs. Tibbetts&mdash;and we frequently
stumbled upon a quiet household of 'poor whites,' who received
us civilly, though by no means graciously. All of these were,
however, strongly 'secesh' in feeling, having had their minds
pretty thoroughly poisoned with the false tales told them by their
late 'superiors' of Yankee injustice and cupidity.</p>

<p>In conversation with the elder Tibbetts, I learned that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
honey-bees often selected the trunks of hollow trees in which to
gather immense deposits of honey, and that in going up a creek
lately he had discovered a tree, which he intended visiting some
time. The idea of a 'bee hunt' was novel to me, and I determined
to join him; and, a few days after, with a comrade,
started for Tibbetts' house, who readily undertook to pilot us
upon our saccharine expedition.</p>

<p>We were successful in getting a considerable amount of
honey; but staid out so late that the officers became alarmed at
our absence, thinking we were 'gobbled up' by the 'rebs,' and
doubled the guard, served out extra ammunition, &amp;c.,&mdash;and
when we did come in at last, reprimanded us for staying out so
long, and forbid any of the men going beyond the lines in
future.</p>

<p>Time wore on. At first we expected a recall at the end of
each week after our time had expired, but no such order came,
and as the season was beginning to wear the sear and yellow
leaf in its garments, and the indications of cold weather warned
us that the time was at hand when</p>


<p class="center">"The wild deer and wolf to their covert" must "flee,"</p>


<p>we bethought us that the negro village might abound in material
of which shanties might be erected, and, as Billy Patterson
elegantly expressed it, "be a d&mdash;d sight more comfortable than
miserable." This bright thought was slow in spreading, and it
was not until three or four men of a mess erected a snug shanty,
that it took root and flourished&mdash;and then there was a rush for
the 'diggins.'</p>

<p>The shanties at the outpost, once the shelter of the humble
household gods of many a smoky descendant of Ham, were
threatened with disembowelment&mdash;until the fury of the onslaught
was turned upon the cotton gin, which soon presented a skeleton
appearance. The plundered boards and scantling had to be
carried by the men half a mile. But they set to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with a will. For at least two weeks nothing could be heard
around the camp, from sunrise to the going down thereof, but
hammer and saw, and saw and hammer, and from the promiscuous
heaps of purloined boards and scantling there arose in
due time one of the most curious villages that could be met with
outside of negrodom; but they were as comfortable as could be
desired, and well laid out with bunks, gunracks, &amp;c. Each had
a flue or chimney for a stove or fireplace, the bricks to build
which had to be carried on the back, or wheeled by hand from
a mile and a half to two miles; and as wood was plenty, we
never lacked for good fires. Thus comfortably situated, it was
no wonder that we became attached to Evans' Mills.</p>

<p>It being designed to erect permanent barracks in the vicinity
of Newbern, and the steam saw mill in that city proving insufficient
to supply enough lumber&mdash;workmen being plenty, a
detail from any of the New England regiments supplying any
number needed&mdash;it was resolved to repair the broken dam at
Evans' Mills. A detachment of about sixty contrabands, under
the superintendence of a sort of Baron Munchhausen chap, a
private in a New York artillery regiment&mdash;was sent to make the
necessary repairs.</p>

<p>The dam had broke away at the waste water gate&mdash;and the
genius who was sent to repair it, commenced by filling in the
waste gate with brushwood and earth&mdash;and, after a month's
labor, (costing the Government over $1,500), he succeeded in
partially stopping the water, so that a few thousand feet of
boards could be sawed; but the first rain-storm swelled the dam
so much that, having no proper outlet for the superabundant
water to escape, it gave way, and the blundering fool and his
work departed about the same time&mdash;the former to hospital
sick, and the latter to be distributed along the oozy bottom of the
tortuous creek which emptied into the Trent River.</p>

<p>When the rebels were defeated at Newbern, Evans, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
other large planters, sent all his slaves to a plantation which he
owned in the upper part of the State&mdash;that is, all who were
worth sending, for he left two old negroes and their wives behind
to 'take charge' of the plantation. These, in process of
time, and the occupation of the place by our forces, were joined
by others, until the negro population at the time our company
went there, amounted to about ten, including picaninnies. The
old negroes alluded to were called respectively, Old (Uncle)
George, and Indian Joe. The former venerable old patriarch
was "eighty-five, sar," communicative and religious, and the
latter a cross between the Negro and Indian&mdash;retaining a good
deal of the aboriginal physique and character&mdash;respectful, but
retiring in his manner; and, though said to be fully as old as
George, was spry and supple, a good hand at a tar-kiln, and a
keen sportsman, never going to the woods without being accompanied
by his dogs and an old Harper's Ferry musket&mdash;</p>

<p>"For you know de coons come out sometimes 'fore dark, and
de deer dey stray off up dar down here in de day, and dey's
good eatin', I reckon, is dem deers."</p>

<p>"I suppose you would not hesitate to pink a rebel if he should
come across you instead of a deer, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Lor, yes&mdash;no&mdash;reckon&mdash;(scratching his head). O yes&mdash;right
good day, sar&mdash;good morning, sar."</p>

<p>I think he'd shoot&mdash;if the alternative was to shoot or be
taken.</p>

<p>The other contrabands were mostly runaways. One of
them, a mulatto, was a good carpenter, a man of some intelligence,
and interested me much. His story was simple, and
illustrated the atrocious system, which subverts honor, and
makes conscience a tool to be used as interest may dictate. He
was 'raised' (that is the term, and sounds odd when applied to
human beings) up country, and when his old master died he
left him free; but the son and heir not liking to lose a 'right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
smart boy' of his description, would not give him his freedom,
but kept him as a slave, treating him precisely like the other
bondmen. When the war broke out, his master, who resided
or did business at Wilmington, joined the navy, as captain of a
gunboat, and took this slave with him as his servant. After the
battle of Roanoke, when our gunboats followed up and destroyed
the rebel fleet, his master, when one of our gunboats ran into
the one he commanded, deserted him, jumping overboard, to
escape capture; but, while in the water, a stray shot struck him,
and he 'sank to rise no more.' The mulatto, glad of the change
that gave him his liberty, accompanied our forces to Newbern,
and there remained, entered the employ of the Government, and
performed his part in a skillful and faithful manner.</p>

<p>Another of the contrabands was a full-blooded African negro,
bearing the classical name of Nero. He was from Duplin
County, some ninety miles north of Newbern, and near the
Virginia line, and had run away from a cruel master, as numerous
scars on his person testified, travelling the entire distance
on foot through woods and swamps, and subsisting upon an
occasional ear of corn, for which he ventured into the fields
only at night, eluding the rebel patrols and pickets, and, finally,
almost exhausted and worn out, he arrived, with about five or
six others from the same place, inside our picket lines, and gave
himself up. He left behind him a wife and six children; but
notwithstanding this, and the stories he had heard of Yankee
barbarity to runaway negroes (the slaves being generally told
that the Yankees placed iron rigs through the shoulder-blades
of the darkies, and sold them off to Cuba), he was willing to
run all risks for the bare chance of obtaining his liberty; and,
he said, if the other slaves knew how well the contrabands were
treated, they would come in in greater numbers. His simple
story would fill an interesting volume. When Wild's brigade
was subsequently organized, he joined the first regiment, and, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
have no doubt, has proved himself a capital soldier. Wo to the
rebels that fell in his power. He had many wrongs to avenge,
and would avenge them, if opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Uncle George was a good specimen of the ideal negro&mdash;fat,
good-natured, and seemingly contented.</p>

<p>"Well, uncle," I said, "how do you like the Yankees?"</p>

<p>"Right well, sar&mdash;dey's bery fine people, sar!"</p>

<p>"Would you sooner be with the Yankees than the rebs?"</p>

<p>"O yes, sar; (my name's George, sar); 'cause I'se a free man
now, and dat's what I am now, sar."</p>

<p>"You think you are free now, and that the Yankees made you
free, do you?"</p>

<p>"O yes, sar," he replied, and then added, in a deeply impressive
voice&mdash;"and I tank de Lord and you Yankees for dat. De
ole man hab worked for many years&mdash;de good Lord he send
me and the ole woman six sons and five daughters, and massa,
he sell some off afore de war, take some away when de Yankees
come&mdash;and now, de poor ole man and de poor ole woman
am left all alone in de world; but de good Lord send de Yankees,
and dey make us free afore we die, and dat am payment
enough for all ole George's work&mdash;bress de Lord, amen."</p>

<p>George finding, I suppose, that I took an interest in him, and
did not treat him as it might be inferred many would from their
salutation of "Hello, old nig&mdash;how dye <em>do</em>," often visited our
shanty at dinner-time, and we had always plenty of crackers
and 'salt horse,' and an occasional pint of soup or coffee to spare
him; but the cook (Billy Patterson,) perhaps from pure good
nature, took a fancy to old George, and he soon forsook our
more humble board for the savory flesh-pots of Billy's cookhouse,
perfectly satisfied to be addressed as you 'd&mdash;d old nigger,'
so long as he had his revenge in the shape of a plentiful
supply of good grub.</p>

<p>I stated before that the outpost guard was drawn in at night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to the mills (the day-guard at the mills being camp-guard at
night). A few darkies, who worked for the government making
tar and cutting saw logs, lodged in the mill. Without education
enough to read, without the knowledge of the commonest
accessories of amusement, it cannot be wondered that the time
hung heavily upon their hands; but their naturally elastic temperaments
stood them in good need, and suggested a species of
amusement to pass away the time that was best suited to their
capacity, viz.: dancing and its promoter, 'jigging'&mdash;a species
of vocal and pantomimic music almost peculiar to the African
race. At first their levees were attended only by gents of color;
but, by and by, the spirit of their performances began to spread,
and soldiers from the relief guard and the camp visited them,
and enjoyed hugely the sight of the dancing, sweating darkies,
(encouraging and applauding the most expert&mdash;and there were
many supple legs and nimble feet among them), and the equally
sweating and nimble 'jiggers' or time-beaters. The 'jiggers'
did not always depend upon the voice, but used it as a sort of
auxiliary or flourish to their time-beating, which latter was performed
by striking the open hands upon the thighs, legs and
breast, and together in rapid succession, and in admirable measure,
so that the tune thus beat could be followed by the dancer
as precisely as if played upon a full band.</p>

<p>We had a Maryland negro in our company, who ran away
from his master, and became attached to the regiment in Baltimore.
He was called 'Pomp'&mdash;a lithe, supple fellow&mdash;and, with
a few months training, I have no doubt, would equal, if not
surpass, some of the clog-dancers of our friends the Morris
Bro's. It was amusing to note the patronizing airs he adopted
towards the North Carolina 'nigs,' and, I presume, the circumstances
of his having come from Maryland, and being so long
in the army, added not a little to obtain for him a certain kind
of prestige among his simple sable brethren. The soldiers for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
amusement taught him the manual of arms, and so naturally
did he take to the business that it was a common remark among
the men that there were few better drilled men in the command
than Pomp. But Pomp became lazy and independent, and left
the company shortly after we went to Evans' Mills to work for
Government. But his mind was not in work, and after a few
weeks labor he went to Newbern, and there became attached to
a company of the 43d Mass. regiment, as Captain's servant.
This captain (I know not his name, or I should record it, to his
credit), taught him as well as some other negroes, to read and
write; and, when the policy of the Government, directing the
enlistment of the blacks, reached North Carolina, Wild's brigade
began to be formed, Pomp was among the first to enlist,
and, for his proficiency in drill, and quickness for military
duty, he was made a sergeant in the North Carolina colored
regiment.</p>

<p>"I've been made free by de President of my country," he said
to me, when I met and congratulated him upon joining the
army, "and I tink it is my duty to fight for de country dat
makes me a free man."</p>

<p>This regiment afterwards bore a prominent part in the unfortunate
battle of Olustee, Florida. I wonder if poor Joe (he
changed Pomp to Joseph) escaped.</p>

<p>On the 28th of August, the 17th reg't embarked on transports
for the purpose of capturing Plymouth; but upon arriving
opposite that town, found the place too well defended to warrant
a landing, and they returned without disembarking.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October, the 17th regiment left Newbern on
board steamers, and proceeded up the Neuse River about eight
miles, where they were joined by cavalry, artillery, and a large
baggage train, the whole under command of Colonel Amory.
They landed and marched to Swift Creek, a small settlement
eight miles distant, which was reached at sundown. Here they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
were fired upon by the rebel cavalry picket, who had destroyed
the bridge over the creek. They fled upon our approach. The
following forenoon was employed by our forces in building the
bridge, and at noon the column was again in motion towards
Washington, N. C., which our forces reached on the evening of
November 1st, without molestation.</p>

<p>November 2d, the line of march was again continued, (our
forces being augmented by the addition of several thousand infantry,)
in the direction of Williamston. Towards sundown
the advance came up with the enemy; posted behind entrenchments,
at a place called Rawle's Mills, who disputed their passage;
but our forces soon compelled them to retreat, and the
following morning the advance again continued on to Williamston,
which place the column reached at noon, having marched a
distance of twenty-three miles from Washington. Leaving the
sick and foot-sore on board the gunboats in the river, the troops
marched out of the town about three miles, and bivouacked for
the night.</p>

<p>November 4th, they took up the line of march for Hamilton,
within two miles of which they were obliged to halt for several
hours to build a bridge, near which was a deserted breastwork,
leading from the woods across the main road to a fort on the
river bank. Hamilton was reached about sundown, and, like
Williamston, was found entirely deserted. The town being set
on fire by the troops, the sick were placed on board gunboats,
and the expedition marched out of Hamilton several miles, and
bivouacked for the night.</p>

<p>November 5th, they started early in the morning, taking the
road to Tarboro'&mdash;marched until night, when they came to a
halt, and bivouacked within nine miles of Tarboro'. The following
morning they commenced their return march, not having
met with the enemy in any force. A heavy rain having set in,
the roads were in a bad condition, and the marching much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
harder than it had been previously. The expedition reached
Hamilton late in the afternoon, and took up their quarters for
the night in the deserted dwellings.</p>

<p>November 7th, a violent snow storm raged in the morning,
but it did not delay the march, which was continued for Williamston,
by a road leading near the river, and which they had
not travelled before. No force of the enemy appeared to interrupt
the march, and the expedition reached Williamston in the
afternoon, where it remained until the morning of the 9th,
when the line of march was taken up for Plymouth, N. C., a
distance of twenty-three miles. They reached the latter place
the next morning, 10th, and Newbern on the 11th, at noon,
having been absent thirteen days, and having marched about
150 miles. The expedition captured about 50 prisoners, 400
horses and mules, and about 100 teams.</p>

<p>The failure of this expedition, and the causes of its failure,
are pretty well known, and need no comment from me, save
that it caused much hardship to the troops comprising it, and
left Newbern in an almost defenceless state. The rebels, judging
that the garrison of the city had been largely drawn upon (but
never dreaming that this was the case to so great an extent), to
divert, perhaps, whatever after purposes our commanders had,
and to make them recall the troops as fast as possible, sent a
weak force to demonstrate in front of Newbern. This drove in
our pickets, and created the utmost apprehension in the city.
The case seemed critical, and every available man was called
inside the defences to await the onslaught of the enemy.</p>

<p>Our company (the remainder of the regiment being in the
expedition,) received hurried orders to report in Newbern, and
rumors coming in heralded the enemy as advancing upon the
city in large numbers. The order to pack up and be ready to
march at a minute's warning, was received by us just as we
were 'turning in,' and was not very welcome news you may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sure, but to hear was to obey; and in half an hour we were
ready for the road, and some talked of the morrow, what the
'row' was all about, whether we should have a fight, and others
(myself among the number) went to bed and slept. About
three o'clock in the morning I was aroused from a pleasant sleep
by my comrades, and heard all around me the hurried tramp of
men. Hastily putting on my knapsack, I seized my gun, and
went forth to take my place in the line. The night was foggy,
and a feeble moon, while it brightened the obscurity a little, lent
to the half distinct scene a dreary and confused appearance. A
few men had been detailed to destroy the bridge; and the
strokes of the axe, the falling of the planks and beams into the
water, the hum of the camp&mdash;its lights glancing to and fro, contrasted
with the solemnity of the surrounding silence (which
only echoed noises of our hasty departure, or the hoot of the
owl) left a cheerless impression on my mind.</p>

<p>After a march of two hours, we reached our old camp tired
and exhausted, to be refreshed by a good dipper of coffee.</p>

<p>The morning advanced but the rebels came not; and as reinforcements
arrived by the railroad from Beaufort, all apprehensions
of the result of an attack upon the city died out, and the
day wore away without any demonstration being made against
any part of our lines. Indeed, word came in from our scouts,
that the rebels had fallen back, satisfied, no doubt, with having
carried out their design of creating a diversion, which would
serve to hasten the recall of the expedition.</p>

<p>In the evening we received orders to return to Evans' Mills,
which place we reached by nightfall.</p>

<p>What must have been the surprise and dismay of the darkies
to work on the mill-dam (who knew nothing of our departure
during the night, although we made noise enough to rouse the
'seven sleepers') upon waking in the morning to find the bridge
destroyed and the camp deserted. We were told that they no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sooner heard of our departure&mdash;and the reports, greatly exaggerated,
no doubt, of a rebel attack upon Newbern&mdash;than, considering
it was 'all up' with them, they scattered, and made for
the woods&mdash;'every man for himself, and the devil take the hindmost.'
Some of them turned up in the vicinity of Newbern,
others made their way to Morehead City and Beaufort, while
others were never heard from, and these, it was thought likely,
being too frightened to venture out in the clearings, supposing
the whole country again in possession of the rebels, were starved
to death, or lost their way, and came out somewhere in Dixie&mdash;no
doubt into the lion's mouth they were trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Poor unfortunates, the sport of every varying breeze of
fortune, good or ill. The best fortune for them is as yet but indifferent,
while ill fortune is death. They are, alas, no 'chosen
people of God.' They have no Moses to organize and lead them
out of their land of bondage; no cloud by day or pillar of
fire by night to guide them; no ark of their freedom's covenant
around which to rally [yes, the starry flag is their ark, and,
thank Heaven, wherever it waves over them they are free!]
No miracles are vouchsafed for their preservation; no manna
from heaven; no quails; no water gushing from the rock to
assauge their thirst. Alas! alas! that their pathway to freedom
should be beset with so many dangers&mdash;that its course should so
often lead them through the valley of the shadow of death!
Poor creatures! heaven help them through the fiery ordeal in
which they are passing!</p>

<p>The old darkies, however, belonging to the mill, together with
the others who had not been there when we came, did not skedaddle;
but, by turns, kept a good look-out on the Pollocksville
road, ready, of course, to leave at the approach of the rebels,
though determined not to do so until they hove in sight. Old
George took charge of our camp, closed every door, and when
we returned, every article we were forced to leave behind, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to the smallest and most trivial, remained just as we had
left it.</p>

<p>Back once more in our comfortable quarters, and resuming
our old routine of duty, we began to think that we were as
good as settled for the winter. Our old pastimes were revived&mdash;rambling,
fishing, quoit pitching, playing cards, backgammon,
and draughts. The same huge fires were kindled and burned
brightly in front of our quarters, and at the outposts, for the
guards to warm themselves by in the dreary watches of the
chilly night, around which, before retiring to rest, groups of
smoking men assembled, and spun many a yarn of strange adventure
in all lands, from the orient to the Occident, and from
the frozen regions of the north to the trackless southern seas&mdash;mostly
true, I believe, but surely entertaining.</p>

<p>This state of affairs lasted a few weeks longer, when suddenly
we received orders to rejoin the regiment, which took the place
of the Mass. 23d in doing the provost duty at Newbern. This
was about the 20th of November. To some this change was
delightful, while to others (and I was one of these) it was not a
welcome change. But we packed up&mdash;this time with more
deliberation&mdash;and the next morning when Co. A, 23d regiment,
Captain Brewster, came to relieve us were ready to evacuate,
leaving everything connected with the camp to our successors,
in apple-pie order. I wish they could (or did) return the compliment;
but they did not, and were so 'put out' about being
put out of Newbern, that they vented their spleen upon the luckless
houses occupied by them as quarters, smashing up every
thing that might conduce to the comfort of their successors.</p>

<p>Our quarters were on Pollock street, near the market and
the office of the Provost Marshal. Co. B's quarters adjoined
ours, and F occupied quarters on the other side of the street
nearly opposite. After considerable labor in sweeping, scrubbing,
making bunks, &amp;c., we became settled down once more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
comfortable enough. But our duty was no child's play. We
were on guard every second day&mdash;the intermediate one being
filled up (twice a week) by a march of six miles and a brigade
drill of three hours or more. This did not leave much time to
ourselves, after cleaning boots, polishing brasses and buttons,
and brushing clothes, for we had to appear neat and tidy while
on duty.</p>

<p>A provost guard is a kind of police-soldier, and his duties
are as multifarious as the character of his office and power
is indefinite. His instructions vary in detail from day to day;
and, before he goes on duty for the day has a string of orders
and regulations, as long as the laws of the Medes and Persians,
read to him, often couched in language that could be defined
to mean one thing or another, or nothing at all in particular.
For example, the guard is told to examine <em>all</em> passes and salute <em>all</em>
officers; to permit no fast driving; to allow no soldier or man-o'-war
sailor to go by him unless provided with passes properly
countersigned; to allow no citizen to pass after a certain hour,
without a special permit from the provost marshal; to 'jug'
every negro found out after 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; to allow no citizen or negro
to be abused; to allow no breach of the peace; to permit no
horses to be tied to trees; to stop all disturbances whatever indoors
or out of doors; to, in fact, keep his eyes 'peeled,' and be
continually on the alert, and, if possible, do all the impossible
things required of him. Four hours on post (and twice posted)
performing this delightful duty, was required of the man detailed
for guard. The accommodations at the guard-houses were
abominable. The windows were broken, the bunks smashed up,
poor fires, and the floors so dirty, and the cricks and crevices
around so filled with vermin that one night's experience in the
endeavor to get rest in them was generally sufficient to deter
most of those who still retained the idea that cleanliness was a
virtue from ever attempting the like again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Major Frankle of the 17th regiment was Provost Marshal,
and was a worthy successor of Col. Kurtz, of the 23d (now
Chief of Police in Boston.)</p>

<p>I cannot enter into a relation of all the incidents which enlivened
the monotony of our provost duty in Newbern, not from
lack of good material&mdash;that would, perhaps, make thirty or
forty pages of readable matter, but want of space admonishes
me that it will not pay. Suffice it to say that, with forty or fifty
thousand men in the department, a large proportion of whom
were in the vicinity of Newbern&mdash;the 17th had their hands full,
and the lock-up often became overcrowded, as did the jails in
time. We had drunken men to arrest&mdash;street rows to quell,
horse-racings, shootings and stabbings to look after&mdash;brawls in
bad houses to put a stop to, and arrest drunken and half-crazed
men armed to the teeth, and other duty of a no less dangerous
character to perform. But I believe we did things 'up to the
handle;' in fact I'm certain we did&mdash;notwithstanding there
were many complaints (as there always must be in such cases)
and criticisms of our method of procedure.</p>

<p>To add to our already heavy labor, shortly after we were in
the city, the marine battalion (which I have before incidentally
spoken of,) had refused to do further duty, and were placed in
our custody. These gallant fellows had been shamefully used.
When enlisted in New York city, they were promised $18 per
month for the privates, or sailors, and pay in proportion for the
petty officers. They had been in the service over a year, had
not received any pay, clothing, or allowances for the same, and
were informed that they would not be recognized in any other
capacity than soldiers, with whom they must consider themselves
on an equal footing in pay, as in all other respects. Considering
this a violation of agreement, they refused as a body to
shoulder a musket or do any kind of duty, and thus passively
mutinied. The men of the 17th pitied the poor fellows, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
showed them many acts of kindness. The Major, too, while he
had to enforce their imprisonment, sympathized with the marines,
and, I have reason to believe, did all in his power to have
their just claims considered, and their wrongs righted; but the
knot on the 'red tape' which bound the poor fellows could not
be opened, and it was not cut. So, after a two month's imprisonment,
they were given the choice of servitude in the forts as
criminals, or the alternative of enlisting in the navy, and they
wisely accepted the alternative. I think theirs was a case of
peculiar hardship. Some of those human kites which abound in
large cities started the project of their enlistment, without the
approval of the Government, made money out of the affair, and
left their victims to curse them for many a weary heartburn,
many an anxious, hopeless thought of home, and of a perhaps
destitute family.</p>

<p>One of Co. K's men, named Finn, at one time a guard over
the marines, allowed two of them to go out to purchase something
at the market, but the Major, somehow, discovered the
charitable error, and rushing up to the guard, said:</p>

<p>"Vat for you let ze marines go away?"</p>

<p>"But they'll come back again, sir."</p>

<p>"O&mdash;fool&mdash;fool&mdash;I vill have you put under arrest and court-mar<em>shal</em>!"</p>

<p>Soon after the marines returned, and Finn, who caught sight
of the Major passing, sung out&mdash;</p>

<p>"They're back again, Major! The marines"&mdash;</p>

<p>But the Major, who was in a hurry, passed him by, angrily
exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"O fool&mdash;fool&mdash;o-h block-head!"</p>

<p>"Be jabers," said Finn, looking after the Major, but taking
care he was not heard by that officer,&mdash;"ye're the first man that
ever called me so far out of my name that I didn't lay on the
broad of his back!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>There were four other Massachusetts regiments in the department,
viz:&mdash;the 23d, 24th, 25th, and 27th.</p>

<p>The 23d regiment, Col. Kurtz, was recruited in Lynnfield,
which place it left for Annapolis, Md., on the 11th of November,
1861, and reached there on the 16th; and on January 6th,
1862, embarked upon transports as a portion of Gen. Burnside's
Expedition to North Carolina.</p>

<p>The regiment, after encountering the fearful storms off Hatteras,
was among the first to land on Roanoke Island, and in the
engagements which followed bore a conspicuous and honorable
part. It then accompanied the expedition up the Neuse,
and took an active part in the battle of Newbern (March 14th,
1862), where it lost ten killed (including its Lieut. Colonel,
Merritt) and forty-one wounded.</p>

<p>The 23d afterwards did picket duty, and took part in nearly
all the expeditions into the interior and along the sea-coast.</p>

<p>On May 7th, the 23d relieved the 25th Mass. regiment doing
provost duty in Newbern, where it continued until Nov. 20th,
when it was in turn relieved by the 17th.</p>

<p>In January, the 23d formed part of the expedition to South
Carolina, but did nothing, owing to a misunderstanding between
Gens. Foster and Hunter, and returned, in April to North
Carolina, and encamped at a place called Carolina City, near
Morehead City.</p>

<p>Later it was transferred to Norfolk, and, I believe, is at present
in that portion of the department.</p>

<p>The 23d bears the reputation of being a good regiment, and
stands high on the roll of honor. Success to the old 23d.</p>

<p>The 24th Mass. regiment, Col. Stevenson, was recruited at
Readville, and formed part of the Burnside expedition to North
Carolina, and in the battles of Roanoke Island and Newbern,
acted a conspicuous and noble part. This regiment, in common
with others, had its share of marching on expeditions and doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
picket duty (in which it had several sanguinary engagements
with the enemy, who were invariably defeated). It accompanied
Gen. Foster to South Carolina, where it has added fresh
laurels to its name, as well as in Florida, where it remained until
April last. The 24th is a splendid regiment. It is now in the
army of the Potomac, and has shared in the triumphs which
have at length rewarded that long-suffering but noble and brave
army&mdash;that has at length came 'out of the wilderness.'</p>

<p>The 25th regiment, Col. Upton, was raised in the western
part of the State, and left Camp Lincoln, Worcester, to join
Burnside, and take part in his expedition. Little need be said,
save that this regiment has inscribed on its banners such names
as 'Roanoke Island,' 'Newbern,' 'Kinston,' 'Whitehall,' 'Goldsboro,'
&amp;c., &amp;c. This regiment did the first provost duty in North
Carolina. The 25th has taken part&mdash;together with the 23d and
27th&mdash;in the late brilliant advance of Gen. Butler on Richmond,
where it has come in for its share of glory and hard knocks.</p>

<p>The 27th, Col. Lee, was also raised in the western part of
the State, and left Springfield Jan. 6th, and joined Burnside's
troops at Annapolis, Md. The 27th shared in all the battles,
marches, and picket-skirmishes in North Carolina. In fact, the
history of one of these regiments is the history of the whole.
All, alike, have a glorious record, and have earned the same by
the hardest kind of fighting, marching and suffering.</p>

<p>In October, the first of the nine months regiments began to
arrive. The 44th was, I believe, the first of these&mdash;a fine-looking
body of men; but seeming more like a regiment of officers
than soldiers. Their style of dress, though about the same as
the 'regulation,' varied in being of a much finer texture, and
containing, at least, two more buttons on the tails of their dress
coats than the regulation allowed to privates. (Orders were
issued during our stay in the city to cut off the extra buttons,
and much ill-feeling was created by the remorseless cur-<em>tail</em>-ment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
practiced by the men of the Seventeenth towards their fellow-soldiers
of the 44th.) Some of the men, too, seemed to
possess a consciousness of their superiority, induced, no doubt,
by their fancied higher social standing at home, and passed the
poor three-years men with the same patronizing and patrician
air, their eye-glasses clasped upon their noses in the same manner,
as when strutting amid their fathers' workmen in Massachusetts,
or when promenading the thoroughfares, and ogling the
girls (beg pardon, young ladies) at home. It is true they were
civil, and mostly well-behaved young men; but their civility,
though well intended, was bestowed with a hauteur which had an
opposite effect, and left rankling in the minds of their less
favored comrades (all soldiers are comrades) a feeling of envy
and, perhaps, disgust. Undoubtedly, there were men in this
regiment of a very high order of intellect; but there was a
class among them composed of puny clerks and school-boys,
whose notions of the world and what constituted a man were
about as crude as those of any apron-string hero could be;
and it was the influence of this class operating as the representative
of that better and really respectable one whose good sense
kept it in the background, which caused this regiment to be
unjustly criticised and hated&mdash;and by none more than its co-nine
months comrades of other organizations. To show how prejudice
will jump at conclusions, it was confidently predicted
they would never stand fire; but they did stand fire bravely,
and acted in many respects in a most creditable manner for so
new an organization. A story went the rounds, and which may
not be true, to this effect:&mdash;On the Tarboro expedition, the 44th
were in the advance, when the cavalry, after waking up the
rebs, and finding them in large force ahead, fell back, and their
lieutenant (Mix), seeing no one taking the necessary steps in
such an emergency, rode up to the captain of an advance company
of the 44th, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Deploy your men, captain; the rebs are close upon us!"</p>

<p>To which the captain replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't know how!"</p>

<p>"Then," replied Mix, "right about, and run like hell, or you'll
be gobbled up!"</p>

<p>Again, at the battle of Kinston, it was said that the 44th who
were laying down, were ordered to charge the rebel line, which
had begun to waver and show signs of weakness; that they
refused, and the 10th Connecticut (three hundred strong) were
ordered up, charged upon the rebels, and, in charging, had to
walk over the prostrate 44th. I give this story without vouching
for its truth; for, being in another part of the field, I had
not an opportunity of witnessing the inception of the charge
referred to, though, arriving with our regiment near the bridge
by the flank ahead of the main charging column, I had an
opportunity of seeing the 44th come up at the double-quick
close on the heels of the flying rebels. But the story was told,
and told, too, on the battle-field.</p>

<p>At Whitehall, however, no envious tongue could say aught
against the conduct of this regiment; and I can here speak of
what I saw of them, and can say they acted well under the
murderous fire to which they were exposed.</p>

<p>Another anecdote of the 44th, and I have done with them;
and, lest I might be accused of harboring any of that feeling
towards them I have already alluded to as prevailing in the
department, and which I most heartily condemn, I will state
that I do not believe one word of it, and only give it a place here
to show how far human malignity and envy will make men forget
what is due to self-respect and to co-laborers in a good work.
During the siege of Little Washington, it was stated that the
rebels sent in a flag of truce, requesting the commander of the
post to send the women and children, <em>and the 44th</em>, to a place of
safety, as they were going to assault the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The 5th regiment came about the same time the 44th did.
They were a fine, hardy-looking set of men, and participated
with credit in all the expeditions undertaken during their term
of service in this portion of the department.</p>

<p>The 45th regiment was the next&mdash;a fine body of men; but
they, too, like the 44th seemed to assume too much importance,
and came in for their share of ill-will; but, speaking from my
own knowledge, I never knew of but one instance in their whole
career where they did not seem to be up to the mark, and this
time from no fault of the rank and file. The fault, if any, lay
with the officers. I allude to a little affair at a place called
Cole Creek, on the railroad towards Kinston, in May '63, where,
by the Colonel of the 45th outranking our Lt. Col., the regiment
had the advance, and when it came in sight of an earthwork
manned by a few rebs, the Colonel anxious for his men, and not
wishing to be precipitate, seemed to hesitate. Colonel Fellows
riding up, asked him why he did not advance on the enemy's
work, replied that he thought it too strong.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Colonel Fellows, "and I will take it with my
two flank companies."</p>

<p>The consent was obtained, and companies A and F of the
17th walked into the works, which had been hastily abandoned
on their approach by the rebels. As I said before, this result
was no fault of the rank and file of the 45th, whom I have seen
marching in under fire, with ranks precisely dressed up, and
acting with coolness and intrepidity.</p>

<p>The 43d seemed the favorite regiment with the three-years
men, who regarded it as the best of the nine months men.
They were, indeed, a fine lot of men, and, I have no doubts if
circumstances placed them in the post of danger, they would
prove themselves fully as reliable as the three-years troops.
In saying this, it will, of course, be inferred, that I do not consider
the nine-months men as reliable in an emergency as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
three-years men; and, I do not think them so, generally speaking&mdash;not
because the men are inferior in regard to courage or
endurance; but because they are not really soldiers but militia,
and not so self-reliant as the three-years men.</p>

<p>Of the other nine months men I know but little, save that
they were a fine lot of men, and if they did not do anything
to distinguish themselves, it was no fault of theirs, but because
they lacked the opportunity.</p>

<p>A few words in regard to the feeling of the three-years men
towards the nine-months troops. The men of the old regiments,
almost to a man (but there were some exceptions) seemed to
regard them with a feeling of envy and dislike, and the
frequent salutations of 'how are you, three hundred dollars and
a bugle?' partly showed from whence the dislike came. I say
partly, for the other reason was, that, besides receiving so high a
bounty, they could return at the end of their time of service,&mdash;which
to men who had already served eighteen months, and
still had a year and a half to serve, seemed unfair. And certainly,
looking at the matter with their eyes, the thing did
not seem altogether right, though it might very properly be
argued that as the three-years men went into the service with
their eyes open, and agreeing to the terms of the Government,
they had no right to complain.</p>

<p>The indulgent reader, who has accompanied me thus far in
my peregrinations through Dixie, need not be alarmed, upon
looking at the caption of this page, at the prospect of being
bored with so many dry, solid pages as he has waded through in
the first part of this work. I have prepared this literary feast,
if not of the best materials (and I have no better, I assure you),
at least after the most approved style of French cookery, and,
therefore, have kept back the best dishes to the last. It is in
this second part of my humble work, that I hope to give the
most stirring (I might say thrilling) and interesting part of my
narrative of</p>


<p class="center">"Moving accidents by flood and field,"&mdash;</p>


<p>and, if I do not succeed to my own satisfaction, I hope, at least,
to give satisfaction to my patrons. This done, I can pocket the
profits with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>In November, 1862, when the nine-months troops had about
all arrived, the work of brigading them with the old regiments,
and drilling them in field movements, was undertaken and vigorously
prosecuted.</p>

<p>Preparations on a scale of considerable magnitude for a large
expedition had been going on for some time; but to what
point it was destined was wisely kept a secret, though it was
generally understood to have some connection with the movement
of Burnside in Virginia.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December, the war-worn veterans of General
Wessells' brigade (of Gen. Peck's division) arrived in Newbern,
and preparations for the expedition were hastily completed.
The same evening, at dress parade, an order was read from
Gen. Foster to all the regiments, to be ready to march in thirty-six
hours in light marching order, viz.: without knapsacks, carrying
only blankets and overcoats, with three days cooked
rations to be carried in haversacks, seven days' to be conveyed in
wagons.</p>

<p>The following day was a busy one for the quartermasters of
the Subsistence Department, and the cooks. In the evening
the guards were withdrawn, and the 8th Mass. regiment, which
had not yet been fully provided with arms and equipments, took
charge of the city, and sent out details of men to patrol the
streets.</p>

<p>This was a busy night for us all. Like sailors before a storm,
we had to make snug our tackle, and spread only as much sail
as we thought the ship could conveniently carry. Everything
in the shape of spare clothes and blankets were snugly packed
in our knapsacks; and, when the final order came for us to be
in line at three o'clock in the morning, we were ready at the
moment to start. But we visited Billy Patterson, and each man
proceeded to stow away into his haversack what he judged
would be sufficient to subsist him for three days. We then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
turned in, to gain a little repose and freshen our energies against
the morrow.</p>

<p>At three o'clock on the morning of Thursday, Dec. 11, 1862,
we were awakened by the bugle call, and after a hasty meal,
formed in the yard of our quarters, and proceeded to the place
of rendezvous for the regiment on &mdash;&mdash; street. A gray, frosty
mist enveloped the city, which was alive with marching men,
horse, foot, and artillery, and forage and ambulance trains. As
early as was the hour, however, the whole population&mdash;especially
the negro portion&mdash;seemed abroad in the streets, and many a
fervent prayer and good wish for our success were showered
upon us by the poor negro women as we passed along.</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed one, "I know de Lord am walkin' alongside
ob you, and you will beat de rebs, I knows&mdash;I knows!"</p>

<p>"Aunty," sang out a soldier from the ranks, "if I don't come
back you'll never get paid for them clothes you washed for me."</p>

<p>"Nebber mind de close, honey," exclaimed the generous old
woman; and then, changing her tone, she continued, as if to
herself&mdash;"Oh, Lord!&mdash;de Lord!&mdash;Oh good Lord!&mdash;Nebber come
back!&mdash;Oh, de poor sojer!&mdash;Lord, help de poor sojer! Amen
for de poor sojer!&mdash;Amen! Glory!"</p>

<p>We halted on the Trent road, just beyond Fort Totten, and
awaited the movement of the various bodies of troops that were
to precede us.</p>

<p>The morning broke clear and cool, and beheld a fine array
of infantry, cavalry, and artillery taking up their line of march
by the Trent road from Newbern. The sight was magnificent
as the long lines of infantry with their polished arms, and the
cavalry and artillery, slowly but cheerfully took up their line of
march, with an elasticity of step and a merry hum of voices that
unmistakeably showed how high the spirits and expectations of
all were aroused, and that it required only an able general to
lead such an army on from victory to victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>As we advanced into the country the evidences of former
strife everywhere met the eye, in the desolated plantations,
houses burned to the ground or partially destroyed, and an air
of ruin and desolation pervading all.</p>

<p>After a tedious, plodding and plunging march of about
fourteen miles, the army bivouacked for the night on a plantation
which seemed more fortunate than many others we passed.
But its time had come; and as regiment after regiment arrived
and stacked arms, it was a curious study to watch the rush they
made for the nearest fence, the eager scramble for rails, and the
disappearance of the fences, as if by magic. As night darkened
over the scene, the countless bivouac fires rose in all directions,
casting a lurid glare up to the sky, and forming about as picturesque
a scene as could possibly be imagined. And the sound of
voices and laughter, and the neighing of horses and unearthly
braying of mules, all combined to render that (my first) bivouac
a something to be remembered forever.</p>

<p>Beyond where we encamped Thursday evening, the rebels
having notice of our approach, blockaded the road for two
miles, by felling trees across; but the pioneers set about
removing them during the night, and when the army resumed
its march in the morning the way was cleared, and we passed
on 'into the bowels of the land.'</p>

<p>About 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, on Friday, a skirmish occurred near Trenton,
between our advanced guard of cavalry and some rebel cavalry
and infantry, in which the latter were routed with the loss
of three or four killed and several wounded and taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Our advance reached Southwest Creek about noon on Saturday,
and the enemy, about 2,000 strong, were posted beyond,
with a battery commanding the road.</p>

<p>The 9th New Jersey and Morrison's battery were sent forward
to feel their position, and a smart cannonade of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
two hours' duration took place, when the 9th New Jersey made
a detour through the woods and captured the battery, putting
the rebels to flight. They made another stand about four miles
this side of Kinston, when the same force pushed after them
and engaged them for about half an hour, when the rebels again
fell back.</p>

<p>While the skirmish was going on, the troops, as they arrived,
were assigned their places in line of battle, almost parallel with
the road. Towards evening, the regiments bivouacked in the
same position they had taken when expecting the assault of the
enemy. We were pretty hungry by this time, you may depend,
not having, some of us, tasted food for nearly two days. When
orders were given to stack arms, there was a general rush for
rails, but some of the boys, while seeking out the latter, came
across some luckless porkers, which bit the dust, were skinned,
and their still quivering flesh subjected to a barely warming
process, ere it was devoured by the half-famished soldiers. I
fell in for a stray piece, and computed that the flesh I was then
devouring, had fifteen minutes before formed a portion of an
animate pig, careless of sorrow, and only seeking some innocent
pieces of garbage or succulent root wherewith to tickle his
palate and satisfy the cravings of hunger. How rapid are transmutations,
sometimes! Little did that pig dream that on the
morrow he would stimulate the nerves of many a soldier in the
defeat of rebels and the capture of Kinston. But so it was;
and this curious fact might lead me, if I were given to abstract
reasoning, to trace this influence of forces by the abundance
of pork. But no; for me are plainer and perhaps more demonstrative
revelations.</p>

<p>There was a house in our front about one fourth of a mile
distant, whither some of our lads found their way, and soon all
the available beds and bedding which the frightened inmates
left behind were confiscated and appropriated by the tired soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The pig did not satisfy me. I was too fond of vegetables
to be satisfied with flesh, and, accordingly, set out at the first
opportunity in search of sweet potatoes. Espying a house upon
a rising ground, about a mile to the right of our encampment, I
made for it; but night came down just as I was starting, and I
was compelled, as it were, to grope my way through a rice-field
or swamp that intervened, where I met many a ditch and
slough, some of which I avoided, and some I fell into. But, nothing
daunted, I held on, and drew near the house, when I beheld
in the darkness the dim outlines of a man in my path, of
what description&mdash;union soldier or guerilla, friend or foe&mdash;I
could not make out. Not being in the mood to stand upon ceremony,
I accosted him as I approached (he proved to be a friend),
inquiring if he knew of any deposit of sweet potatoes in that
region. Returning a cavalry pistol to his belt with which he
had covered me on my approach, he directed me to where I
could find what I desired: and it may be inferred that I was
not slow in availing myself of the opportunity afforded, and
soon set out on my return loaded with sweet potatoes. I had
almost cleared the swamp, and was approaching the camp-guard
of one of our batteries&mdash;in fact I was almost upon the guard&mdash;without
being perceived, when plump! down I went into an undiscovered
ditch or drain, frightening myself as well as the
guard, who brought his piece down to the 'charge,' expecting he
had some atrocious guerilla on hand. I soon explained matters
to his satisfaction, however, and went on my way rejoicing.
My success awakened the hungry ones of Co. K, and the officer
in command, appreciating the necessity of the men having a
good supper, sent half-a-dozen along with me to the scene of my
discoveries. I was a willing guide, and we soon returned with
an abundance of provisions, and made a hearty supper upon
the plunder. We slept well, and awoke next (Sunday) morning
refreshed, and ready for the road and the fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday morning the 14th, we resumed our march on
Kinston. From the place where we encamped, a steep hill
descended, and the road wound through a low, swampy ground
for about two miles, when we came out upon higher land, where
our advanced guard (the 9th New Jersey and Wessells' brigade)
had bivouacked for the night. The advance was already in
motion, and our regiment followed. In the low grounds of
Southwest Creek, we saw the evidences of yesterday's strife&mdash;two
cannon captured, and a few dead rebels. When we passed
the low lands, we saw abundant evidences of hasty preparation
for resisting our advance; but, I suppose, as a very considerable
body of the enemy&mdash;who expected us on the other road where
they were very strongly fortified&mdash;could not be got up in time,
Evans thought it prudent to abandon them. We had not proceeded
far, however, when the crack of musketry told us that
our advance was driving in the enemy's pickets; and soon, as
we shortened the distance between us and the scene of the
coming battle, the more regular and deliberate volleys of small
arms announced that the ball had opened in earnest. Soon the
artillery came galloping up, and took position, just as we reached
the wood skirting the battle field. We were halted, and ordered
on to the right of the road to support a battery.</p>

<p>The enemy were advantageously posted in a swamp, and on
a rising ground beyond, about a mile from the bridge leading
across the river to Kinston.</p>

<p>The action, which was commenced by our advance in the
morning, was sustained with vigor, until the main body of our
forces came up, when the battle became more earnest and terrible,
and, as battery after battery arrived in position, and
opened its fire on the enemy, the ground fairly shook with their
repeated reverberations, while the sharp roll of musketry&mdash;whole
battalions delivering their fire at once&mdash;filled up the intervals.
The rebel position was well chosen, under cover of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
dense undergrowth of wood, their foreground protected by groves
of pines, which, however, offered no impediment to our artillery,
which mowed them down like grass.</p>

<p>I stated that the 17th were ordered to the right to support
a battery. As we marched in to take our position, the officer
in command of the battery, asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"What regiment is that?"</p>

<p>"The 17th Massachusetts," was the reply.</p>

<p>"All right, boys," said the officer, and turning to his men, he
remarked, "I'm glad they didn't send me one of those d&mdash;d nine
months regiments."</p>

<p>We stood a few minutes in the position we had first taken,
the cannon booming away like thunder, and the bullets began
to p-e-e-w athwart our line, quite lively&mdash;hurting nobody however&mdash;when
the artillery officer, who was on horseback, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here they come&mdash;the devils are on us!"</p>

<p>We could see the flash of bayonets at the edge of the wood,
and fully expected a charge. Our Colonel ordered the men to
fall back a few yards to a fence, unsling their blankets, and fix
bayonets. This was done in less time than it takes me to record
it, and we waited with anxiety the onset of the rebels.</p>

<p>Here, for the first time, was I brought into a position that
required courage and resolution; but though I felt determined
to 'do or die,' a strange feeling came over me, and if I was not
really frightened, the feeling was marvelously like fear. I suppose
every man who first goes into action is troubled with a sensation
something akin to that which I felt at this time; but, like
every new sensation, it soon wears off, and the experience of
the actual dangers of conflict serves to obliterate all such
qualms, and leaves the individual in the full enjoyment of a
reckless indifference to what may betide, and an implicit confidence
in that fate which may be the preservation or destruction
of his dear life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>While we were in position awaiting the onset of the enemy,
an incident occurred, which showed how serene men will look
upon others going into the same danger they are in themselves.</p>

<p>A negro teamster, with his ammunition cart, was ordered further
on, to supply another battery on our right whose caissons
were running low of ammunition. The poor fellow thought he
was going to his death, and if ever mortal fear displayed itself
upon the countenance of any human being, it was upon that
poor darky's face. I shall never forget the wild rolling of his
eyes, nor the frenzied and agonized expression of his face, as he
hesitatingly guided his team in front of our regiment, urged on
by our men with such encouraging remarks as&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go it nig; don't be afraid!" "You're a goner, old darky,&mdash;good
bye!" "Won't the rebs chaw him up?" &amp;c.</p>

<p>We waited some time for the rebels to appear, but they came
not. In the meantime, the battery we were supporting was ripping
up the woods in front in fine style&mdash;at every discharge
cracking off the pine trees as it they had been pipe stems.</p>

<p>At length an order came for us to proceed further down to
the right, where the 9th New Jersey and a battery had preceded
us, and here we crossed a swamp, and turned the enemy's
right.</p>

<p>We were to push on; but our Lt. Colonel, not, perhaps, understanding
the order fully, halted us in a cleared field beyond
the swamp, and ordered us to lay down. The 9th New Jersey
were off in the woods to our right, and when I first beheld them
I took them for rebels. From the position occupied, we could
see the long line of intrenchments in our front; but we did not
suppose a river intervened, which was the case. During the
movements just recorded, the firing had been rapid and tremendous,
and, from the cheers of our men, we could clearly infer
that the rebels were giving way. Then was the golden opportunity
for us&mdash;for, had we then advanced as we did afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
instead of taking a few hundred prisoners, we should have captured
an entire brigade&mdash;but it was lost. Col. Amory coming
up soon after, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do you stay here? Forward, as quick as you can!"</p>

<p>The regiment rose like one man, and, on the order being
given to go forward at the double quick, rushed down with a
yell. As we neared the bridge, we beheld a rout&mdash;an almost
indescribable body of men running for their lives. All discipline
seemed lost, and casting aside guns, equipments and clothing,
and, in fact, whatever might retard their flight, they fled like a
herd of frightened deer, while close upon their heels came on
the charging columns of our men. It was a magnificent, and
yet it was a pitiable sight. As intimated before, we succeeded
in bagging a goodly number; but the bridge being set on fire,
we were forced to give over the pursuit until the flames were
extinguished.</p>

<p>While laying down in the field, I observed a substantial looking
two-story house in our front, and near the bridge, a large
portion of the rear of which had been shattered by a shell,
evidently the work of the enemy. I found this the case when
we halted near the bridge, from which position I could observe
that the missile had entered the roof of the piazza, went clean
through the house, bursting as it was penetrating the rear wall,
and making the havoc described. Standing upon the piazza,
the picture of anguish and despair, were two women, who
seemed watching the rout of their army with a terrible and
heart-sick interest, perfectly heedless of the missiles of death
flying around thick and fast. Some of our officers, taking pity
upon the poor women, and solicitous lest the exposure should
endanger their lives, approached, and advised them to retire to
a place of safety. But they resolutely refused to stir from their
dangerous position. Doubtless, they had friends near and dear
to them in the fight, and anxiety for the fate of those loved ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
made them forget the natural timidity of their sex, and thus
risk their lives.</p>

<p>It has been often stated that the women of the South did
more to drive the men to take up arms against the Government
than the politicians. If this be so&mdash;and my experience makes
me think it probable&mdash;then they have most surely reaped in
the whirlwind of desolation which has burst upon their hitherto
peaceful homes the most bitter fruits of the wind of treason
they have sown. To them, unlike the women of the North, the
fields of strife are not afar off, and they do not have to weep for
their braves fallen in the distant battle-field. The clouds of
strife gather and burst about their homes. They see their fields
laid waste,&mdash;their towns and villages made the abode of desolation
and anguish. They behold their sons, brothers, fathers,
and friends stricken down by the hand of war before their eyes.
Danger lurks forever at their doors. Famine&mdash;gaunt, ghastly,
insatiate&mdash;forever hovers in their future, like a bird of ill omen.
They are forced to many a weary struggle to provide the necessaries
of life for their helpless, and too frequently, alas! fatherless
children. Like the first of their sex, they incited disobedience,
and now they find their paradise changed to an abode
of wretchedness and misery, and are compelled, in tears and
wretchedness to eat the bitter fruit of their crime. I have seen
the widowed wife and orphan children standing pale, motionless
and horror-struck over the dead body of the husband and father,
and, with glassy eyes look upon the passing array of their foes,
fierce and triumphant in the 'pomp and circumstance of war;'
and I have thought what a pity that even so great an offence
should have so terrible a punishment. But 'those whom the
gods wish to destroy they first make mad.'</p>

<p>The attack on Kinston was planned and carried out by Gen.
Wessells, and, though the fight was more severe, and of much
longer duration than the battle of Newbern, a difficult position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was carried with comparatively small loss&mdash;(about 100 killed
and 400 wounded).</p>

<p>The rebels had chosen their position, as before stated, upon a
slight elevation beyond a swamp, and on both sides of the Kinston
road. Their left was protected by a church and a growth
of scrub oaks, and their right by a grove of large trees, their
front and both flanks being pretty well protected by a swamp,
difficult to cross, and densely covered with a growth of small
trees and pines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Battle of Kinston</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The brigade of Gen. Wessells opened the ball in fine style,
driving in the rebel advance, and alone sustained the onset of
the rebels, until the brigades commanded by Cols. Amory,
Heckman, and Stevenson got into position, when they formed
the left wing of our line of battle&mdash;Stevenson and Heckman the
centre, and Amory the right.</p>

<p>Gen. Evans commanded the rebel army, which consisted of
over five brigades of about 15,000 men, including a brigade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
home-guards from Raleigh. The other troops were mainly from
South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi. Evans disposed his
men in a skilful manner upon and behind the rising ground he
had chosen for the battle-field, and had several batteries so disposed
as to command the approaches by the road in front, and
his left flank, which, however, was his weak spot. The fire of
the rebels upon our attacking columns was rapid and well-directed,
and did great havoc among them; but our line kept
steadily though slowly, from the nature of the ground, advancing
upon them, and, after a severe contest of over five and a
half hours, and just as the 17th and 9th New Jersey had succeeded
in turning their left, an impetuous charge was made, and
the day was ours.</p>

<p>We halted in a field, and were ordered to lay down, our left resting
on the river. The few remaining rebels on the other side
kept up a desultory but sharp fire upon our men and the 9th
New Jersey in our front.</p>

<p>Orders to fire had not been given, and we had to lay quietly
and forego many a good opportunity of picking off a stray rebel.
But human nature could not stand such inaction always, and
many a sly shot was planted upon the opposite bank, sometimes
with excellent effect. I had my eye upon a rebel who kept
firing from behind a tree, and seemed particularly active in
picking off our men, and suddenly formed the resolve to shoot
him if I possibly could. Slipping quietly to the rear, I made
quick time for the left of our line on the river bank. Just as I
arrived, I found one of Co. K's men, named Kendrick, in the
act of firing, and on looking across to see the result of his shot,
saw a huge porker jump into the air as if struck. Sam fixed
that fellow's hash for him, and it afterwards became a common
saying&mdash;"Who killed that pig?&mdash;Sam Kendrick." But my
man, who was behind a tree, abandoned his shelter and made
off just as I had got my battery into position. I fired, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
throwing up his arms, he fell forward on his face. Feeling like
a prize-fighter, who had drawn his 'first blood,' I leisurely
returned to my place in the ranks, reloading my piece as I
went along, when I was accosted by Capt. Day, who was acting
Major&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have been firing without orders."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What name?"</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>"What company?"</p>

<p>"K."</p>

<p>Going along the line with me to where the company was,
he ordered the officer (Lieut. Greeley) to put me under arrest.</p>

<p>"What will all this amount to, lieutenant?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he laconically replied, "take your place in the
ranks."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" queried some of the men.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied, "only I've been arrested for shooting a
reb."</p>

<p>"Is that all!"</p>

<p>Men were detailed, under the guidance of Major Frankle,
Provost Marshal, to put out the fires which had been kindled by
the retreating rebels, which, in a short time, was accomplished,
and the 9th New Jersey crossed over followed by the 17th.
And here I had an opportunity of seeing some of the most terrible
evidences of human strife. The bridge was actually paved
with cast-off arms and equipments, while in the midst of where
some of the fires had been, I beheld one of the most sickening
sights that ever met my gaze. Some of the poor fellows who
had been wounded by our fire on the retreat, or been trampled
down by the rush of the flying host, were burnt to a cinder, and
I could actually see the fat seething and boiling in the hollow of
the temple of one of the charred remains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon reaching the other side of the river we halted, amidst
a promiscuous mass of dead, dying, and wounded men&mdash;of
clothes, arms and equipments. It was here that the 9th New
Jersey picked up (captured?) the battle-flag of the 22d South
Carolina regiment, a magnificent silk banner, with the palmetto
tree on one side of the field, and a wreath of stars on the other,
and the red, white and red stripes.</p>

<p>A few yards from where we halted, was an abandoned field
piece with its caisson, which the rebs had left behind in their
flight. It was the same cannon which had fired the last rebel
shot in the battle, directed at our regiment, over which it burst,
and wounded two or three men. I had the curiosity to examine
some of the cartridges in the caisson, and found them, as well as
the fixed ammunition of the small arms used by the rebels
labelled with the maker's name (which I forget) 'London,
England.'</p>

<p>After a short halt we advanced up towards the town of Kinston,
whither the 9th New Jersey had preceded us. The road
wound along the river bank to the left for a short distance, and
then took a turn to the right into the centre of the town. At
the entrance to the town, the 9th New Jersey were halted, and
when we came up mutual cheers were exchanged.</p>

<p>Just then Gen. Wessells came riding up at the head of his brigade
of Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers. He was a fine
specimen of a man, tall, straight as an arrow, and with a pleasing,
and even gentle expression of countenance, that indicated a
humane disposition, and these indications were not false, if the
love and admiration of his men were any evidence. He seemed,
by his gray hair and a few wrinkles on his noble face, to be over
fifty years of age; but, otherwise, in elasticity of movement,
apparent vigor, and by the keen, quick glances of his honest
gray eyes, he looked much younger.</p>

<p>The rebels, after collecting their stores and all the cotton they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
could gather into a heap, set them on fire. They also set fire to
the railroad depot, a handsome brick structure, but this was
extinguished by our men before it had made any considerable
headway.</p>

<p>Previous to our entering the town, a flag of truce demanding
its surrender had been sent in; but as it was found the enemy
had abandoned the town, a messenger was sent back acquainting
Gen. Foster with the fact, the party kept on to find the
skedaddlers, if possible. About two miles beyond the town
they came up with Evans, who sent back word to Gen. Foster
to have the women and children removed, as he was going to
return the fire, which all the while had been kept up by our
heavy guns upon his retreating forces. This was simply a ruse
to gain time; for, after our forces had been brought up and
disposed in line of battle, and the cavalry and skirmishers
had advanced up to where they expected to find the enemy, it
was ascertained the bird had flown.</p>

<p>Our regiment, which had been detailed from the brigade, and
when we entered Kinston was ordered on provost duty, in view
of the anticipated fight, was ordered to rejoin the brigade; but,
when the skedaddle was discovered, we were again assigned to
provost duty, and such marching and countermarching, and
shifting, and looking around for a vacant place to serve as quarters
for the night, as the men of Co. K had, never fell to the
lot of so tired and hungry a set of men to experience. I suppose
some of the other companies could boast of a similar experience.</p>

<p>But do not suppose the men of the 17th were satisfied with
only one job on hand at a time. No, sir. They could do provost
duty; but they could also, when hungry, find something to
eat (and drink) if such were comeatable. In this instance the
way poultry suffered was a caution; and there was something
truly ludicrous, too, in the exhibition of men gravely marching
in the ranks, each having in his hand a couple of hens, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a turkey, or a goose, all of which made such a noise and
flutter that it was next to impossible to hear the word of command
when spoken.</p>

<p>The Major (Frankle), who, as a general thing, was very
severe in his denunciations of such proceedings, replied to a
woman, who complained that she had lost all her fowl:</p>

<p>"Vat&mdash;all your shickens gone? You may be tankful it was
no more! If you did not have more to eat than my men, and
march and fight so hard, I tink you would take a little shicken,
too!"</p>

<p>The town of Kinston is one of the neatest and most tidy-looking
I have seen in North Carolina, or, in fact, elsewhere.
It is finely laid out, in a splendid location upon the banks of the
river, the streets running at right angles; the houses well built,
painted white, and to each is attached a beautiful and tasteful
flower garden. The jail was a small but solid-looking structure,
and empty. A church, small, but with a high steeple, (the top
of which had been struck and bent by a cannon-shot), stood in
the centre, and an air of so much quiet and comfort&mdash;so different
from anything we had seen in Dixie, and so unexpected in
this place&mdash;pervaded it, that the men of the 17th incontinently
fell in love with the place, and wished for nothing better than
to do provost duty in Kinston forever.</p>

<p>We had not been long in the town when mines of apple-jack,
peach brandy, and tobacco were discovered, and the various
expedients resorted to by the men to get at the same were as
amusing as they were generally successful. People who left
their houses with clothing and other matters behind, must have
found a considerable change when they came back. Indeed,
some of them returned during our occupation, and a more pitiable
sight could not well be imagined, than those small processions
of timid women and helpless children who came flocking
back to their homes upon being assured of protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Apple-jack and peach brandy, which had been discovered
somewhere by the most expert foragers, soon made their influence
felt, and incited the soldiers to committing many curious
pranks. Here would be seen a burly soldier, with a woman's
dress, even to the bonnet, put on over his own, his musket still
on his shoulder, and linked arm in arm with another soldier,
presenting as grotesque an appearance as could well be
imagined&mdash;while in another place could be seen a party intently
engaged in harnessing a diminutive mule to a vehicle, the quadruped
resenting such freedom as only a mule can.</p>

<p>A cavalryman passed us, with a bucket in each hand, urging
his horse to its utmost speed, and shouting as he went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Plenty of rum, boys!&mdash;lashins!&mdash;lashins!"</p>

<p>The inhabitants (those who remained) looked glum and chop-fallen
enough; but the negroes&mdash;it seemed a gala day to them,
especially the juvenile portion, who ran around among 'de sojers'
as if they were friends returning after a long absence.</p>

<p>"How is you, Yankees? I's glad you'm come!" was the general
salutation; and the negro women vied with each other in
emptying their larders to give 'de sojers suffen good.'</p>

<p>Towards night (having, like Ishmaelites, wandered about all
the evening in search of quarters) we obtained an entrance into
a hardware and furniture store; but just as we were going in
an order came, directing us to guard the prisoners. We proceeded
to the upper end of the town, near the depot, and there
took charge of a squad of about 400 rebels, and escorted them
to a large unoccupied building at the other end of the town.
On our way thither, I had an opportunity of speaking with several
of them. Although they differed in some things, yet they
all seemed to agree in one thing, viz., in being heartily sick of
the war, and desirous of peace.</p>

<p>Observing among them a man in Quaker's garb, I remarked&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Friend, you do not look like a fighting man. How did you
get here?"</p>

<p>To which he replied, in a half-crying tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou art right, friend. I am no fighting man. I never
fought in my life! I don't want to fight&mdash;I won't fight! Thy
horsemen caught me on the road, and thee seest the result."</p>

<p>Observing an elderly gentleman in civilians' clothes, I remarked&mdash;</p>

<p>"You do not look like a soldier either, friend?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," he replied, "I'm not a soldier; nor would my conscience
allow me to fight in the confederate cause. I've always
been a Union man, and am so still."</p>

<p>I cautioned him about expressing sentiments that might compromise
him when we left, as it was not certain how long he
would receive protection from our arms; but he replied, that he
cared not; his sentiments were already well known, and while
he lived he would express them to friend or foe.</p>

<p>Observing he was lightly clad, I asked if he had any friends
in the city who could supply him with clothes and something
to eat. He said his son-in-law, named Patterson, lived just
across the street, and would attend to his wants, if acquainted
with his situation. I offered to carry a message to Mr. Patterson,
who expressed surprise at his father-in-law's arrest, saying
he was one of the few men in that neighborhood, who had all
along remained true to the old flag.</p>

<p>He immediately repaired to the provost marshal's office, and,
I had the satisfaction of knowing, was successful in obtaining
the old gentleman's unconditional release.</p>

<p>We left our blankets and overcoats on the field, and the night
being cold, after our blood had cooled somewhat, when the day's
excitement was ended, we felt the need of some covering, and
a party of our company was made up to go over and get them;
but we could not procure a team, and the project was abandoned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
I, however, had no notion of doing without my overcoat,
and, with two or three others, who were of the same mind,
started for the field. We passed over the place where the
fighting had been thickest, and stumbled upon, and over, evidences
of the deadly strife&mdash;inanimate bodies of friend and foe,
maimed and disfigured. But I will not dwell upon the sickening
scene revealed to us by the light of the camp fires; suffice
it to say, that we were successful in obtaining our clothing
and returned to our temporary quarters tired and hungry.</p>

<p>During our absence, a hotel had been set on fire, whether by
design or through accident, could not be found out. It was
burning fiercely when we returned; and, despite the efforts of
our men to extinguish it, was destroyed, together with some
small dwellings adjacent.</p>

<p>The gunboats had come up to a blockade about four miles
below the city, which was commanded by an earthwork fort;
and, after we had driven the rebels out of Kinston, we could
hear the continuous boom of heavy artillery in that direction.
A squad of the 3d New York Cavalry started for the scene, and
surprised and captured the fort that was pounding away at the
gunboats, and nearly all in it.</p>

<p>The result of our day's work may be summed up in a few
words&mdash;we beat the rebels from a strong position, took over 500
prisoners, and 11 pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>The battle of Kinston was won on the same day on which the
battle of Fredericksburg was fought.</p>

<p>On Monday morning we were awakened early, and with the
9th New Jersey, took up the advance. Recrossing the bridge,
we passed over the battle-field, and here I observed a fine mastiff
laying down beside the body of his dead rebel master. I
had often read of such things; but I had at last the privilege of
seeing for myself that noble instinct of affection which binds so
closely the ties between man and the inferior animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>About two miles on the road to Whitehall (for we had turned
off in that direction), I left the ranks, and went into a house at
the roadside. A poor widow, with three or four young children,
constituted the family. The poor woman seemed terribly frightened,
and in a tremulous voice told me her husband had been
in the rebel army, and had died at Manassas; that she had to
depend for her support, and that of her children, upon the labor
of the loom, and that the house she lived in was given her for
occupation, free, by a gentleman who owned the plantation on
which it stood. She gave me some corn-bread, and I gave her
in exchange a few biscuit and some tobacco, for she smoked;
and with pity in my heart for the poor woman and her helpless
family, I left them, none the worse off for my visit, and rejoined
the regiment which had halted for a rest a short distance ahead.</p>

<p>About mid-day, however, I began to feel my legs growing
stiff, and being unable to keep up with the regiment, I 'fell out'
and straggled&mdash;for the first time. Charles Renaud (our late
cook, whom I have mentioned before) was in the same boat, and
we soon came together, and together trudged on as best we
could, rested together, made our coffee together, and together
visited many points of interest and attraction on our route,
gathering a stray honeycomb here, and a stray piece of corn
bread there; but the grand object of our search (which was
anything of a spirituous or malt nature we could get hold of&mdash;whiskey
preferred) could not be found. At length, shortly after
mid-day, we came in sight of a really handsome one-story cottage
house, evidently the abode of wealth and refinement, and
thither we went, but only to find that we had been anticipated;
the house deserted by all save a negro, and every thing in the
most delightful confusion&mdash;drawers pulled out, and their contents
scattered about, chairs and furniture broken, and every portable
thing of value missing. But we were not disappointed at this,
as our object was not plunder, but&mdash;whiskey. Bringing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
point of my bayonet in close proximity to the darky's breast, I
conjured him as he wished for the success of the North, and his
own freedom and life, to tell me if he had any whiskey or apple-jack
stowed away about the premises. He turned pale (that is,
for a darky), his knees smote together, and, with an agonizing
appeal to spare his life (which was perfectly unnecessary, inasmuch
as I had no notion of confiscating it) and solemn assurances
that there was nothing of the kind on the premises,
directed me to a distillery, which, he averred, lay in from the
road about 'haaf' a mile, on the right hand, just after crossing
the second branch. Off we started, and on our way questioned
a farmer, who, with horse and team, was requested to accompany
the army so that he should not give information to his
rebel friends of its whereabouts&mdash;Foster having given them the
slip&mdash;but he stoutly denied all knowledge of its whereabouts,
averring that there was nothing of the kind within twenty miles.
Somewhat staggered by this information, we were about giving
up the search; but depending more upon the darky's word than
that of Mr. Secesh, we finally concluded to give the place a
trial. We struck off at the point indicated, and followed a
rough cart-road, which, a short distance onward, diverged into
numerous roads and bridle-paths, to choose between which was
no little difficulty. At length we pitched upon one, and having
disencumbered ourselves of blankets, overcoats, and haversacks,
which we secreted behind a fallen tree, set forward,
determined to see the end of that road, at the same time keeping
a wary eye in case we should stumble upon a stray guerilla
party. Instead of going 'haaf' a mile, we went over two
miles before we came in sight of the object of our search, which
was just beyond a grist-mill, on the bank of a stream. We
knew it to be a distillery by the number of casks and barrels
around it, and by the peculiar odor arising from it, borne to our
nostrils on the wings of the wind. But all was deserted; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
mill and still-house were locked, bolted and barred, and our
cautious advance found no opposition from anything animate.
We paused before the strongly protected door of the distillery,
and I doubted our ability to break the lock.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let us smash in ze door."</p>

<p>"But we will be heard by the guerillas who may not be far
off, and what would we do if a dozen of them should come
upon us?"</p>

<p>"Fight, I teenk."</p>

<p>"Fight! What chance would we have against so many?"</p>

<p>"We could fire, and re-treet."</p>

<p>"Yes; but they would probably surround us before we knew it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;dhan, I suppose we must be tak-en pree-so-neer."</p>

<p>"And would you like that, Charley?"</p>

<p>"I sup-pose if we cannot help it&mdash;what you do?" and he
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to run the risk?"</p>

<p>"Oui&mdash;if you say so!"</p>

<p>But believing there might be an easier way of 'breaking
and entering,' besides attacking the formidable door before us, I
suggested a reconnoitre of the rear, where we found an opening
defended only by a few boards nailed crosswise. These were
soon ripped off, and, leaving Charley to guard against any surprise
from without, I entered, taking his canteen, and proceeded
to explore. There was corn in soak, and plenty of empty
casks; but no whiskey. At length I lit upon a stone jug nearly
full, from which came the smell of whiskey, and, giving Charley
to understand I had found the prize, I proceeded to fill both the
canteens, after having accomplished which, I thought it would
be nothing out of the way to save what I had secured as much
as possible, and therefore proceeded to fortify myself with a pull
at the jug; but the first mouthful convinced me that the prize
I had secured was not whiskey, but water (no doubt, the jug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
had contained whiskey once, as was evident from the smell).
Vexed at my disappointment, I proceeded to examine further,
but with no success, and I finally emerged empty-handed as I
had entered. Charley was as much disappointed as I, but a
shrug and muttered 'sacre' was all the evidence he gave of it.
We then broke into the mill; but found nothing there except
corn and some empty kegs. We went to a house or barn in
the rear, filled with corn, but were equally unsuccessful. There
was a house about a mile distant from the mill, and after a consultation,
in which it was taken for granted that it must belong
to the owner of the distillery, we started for it. Within a quarter
of a mile of the house was a grove of young pines, and
there we halted and arranged that I should go forward alone,
and in case of danger Charley could come up at the proper,
time, when I would ask him where he left the rest of the men,
and he was to reply&mdash;"Waiting in the grove." Fixing on my
bayonet, and looking to see if the cap of my piece was all right,
I moved for the house, which I reached without molestation or
discovery, except by a sentinel dog (not a fierce one), who
retreated in good order at my approach. I entered the first
door I came to, and proceeded through a bed room into which
it opened, to the kitchen or general room of the house. My
heavy tread announced a stranger, I suppose, for half a dozen
females and as many children came in at once, and seemed
transfixed and terrified at the apparition they beheld. Giving
assurance that I intended no harm to any of them, I inquired if
the master of the house was at home, and if so, where he then
was? After a little hesitation, they told me he was in the garden,
in front. I went out to him, and he returned my salutation
without any exhibition of ill-will. I inquired if guerillas
were numerous in the neighborhood, which he denied, saying,
however, at length, that there had been 'a right smart'
of mounted men in the neighborhood a short time previously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
At this juncture Charley came up, and I questioned, and
received such answer from him as agreed upon. I inquired
about the distillery, but the planter disclaimed its ownership,
saying that the man who owned it, lived a 'right smart' distance
beyond. Had he any whiskey? No, sir; he hadn't a drop&mdash;we
might search if we pleased&mdash;he had nothing in that line but
some peach brandy (spirits), which had been burnt in the distillation,
but was just as good, and we were welcome to it.
Taking him at his word, we poured into our canteens enough of
the spirits to warrant our filling them with water, and still leave
a strong drink (I didn't have the heart to take all). We then
asked if he had anything to eat, as we were hungry, when his
wife immediately set before us a good dish of pork, corn bread,
and sweet potatoes, which we did ample justice to. The children
became more familiar, and some of the youngest actually
came up to us, to share in our meal. They were the finest
children I had seen in North Carolina. Thanking our host&mdash;for
we had nothing better to give in return&mdash;we retraced our
steps in better spirits, and soon rejoined our struggling and
straggling comrades, who had been, and were still, wending
along on their weary way.</p>

<p>We had in Co. K a young fellow, of small stature, named
Tom McNally, who was one of the regimental 'markers.' Tom
was full of fun, and had a great love for horseflesh. He accompanied
the regiment on every expedition, and it was remarked,
that he always managed to have a horse to ride ('confiscated,' of
course, from rebels, in a manner peculiar to Tom). At the
battle of Kinston, he came in possession of a fine colt; but, during
the afternoon, while engaged in exploring the town, the
animal was stolen by one of the 51st. Tom went up boldly to
the headquarters of the regiment, and demanded the horse; but
the colonel of the 51st told him he had no right to the animal,
and should not have him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've as much right to him as the other fellow," said Tom;
"and if I can't get him any other way, I'll steal him back again!"</p>

<p>And he would have carried out his threat, but eight men of
the 51st were detailed to guard the animal that night, and, of
course, he stood no chance of being successful, and did not try
his hand at the game.</p>

<p>Nothing disheartened, however, he next morning struck off
ahead of the regiment, and had not proceeded above three miles
before he came to a plantation, where he found a fine young
mare; and actually compelled the owner to put on bridle, saddle,
and assist him to mount. The wife of the planter did not
wish to lose the animal, and told Tom she had a better horse in
one of the fields, which he could have instead; but, suspecting
the horse could not be better, he made off amid the complaints
of the woman. One of the 9th New Jersey, who witnessed
the affair told him it was a shame, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Shut up your head!" answered Tom, "you'd be only too
glad to get a horse to ride yourself!"</p>

<p>And, sure enough, it was not long until Tom saw the Jersey-man
mounted on a blind mule he had taken from a negro.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Tom procured a pair of spurs, and on applying
them to the mare's flanks, developed a peculiarity, which his
ready wit soon turned to account, as the following will show:</p>

<p>Riding up to a planter's house, he accosted a negro girl,
and asked her for some eggs. She refused to give him any,
when, turning the horse's heels towards her, and applying the
spurs, the animal began kicking furiously, Tom at the same time
exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you don't get me some eggs, I'll kick your brains out!"</p>

<p>"O lor, massa, don't kill me, and I get de eggs!" she said, and
retreated to the hen-house; but once inside, and feeling secure,
she again attempted to put him off by saying there were no
eggs; when, without further parley, he backed his nag up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
against the hen-house, and giving her the spurs, the animal
commenced kicking against it so violently, that the wench, fearing
the building would be knocked about her ears, piteously
begged him to desist, and she would get him all the eggs he
wanted. Tom drew off from the attack, and received the fruits
of his victory, in the shape of a dozen eggs. The same persuasive
force also procured a canteen full of peach brandy. But
luck is often a fickle jade, as is a strange mare, sometimes; for,
the very qualities in Tom's animal of which he was so proud,
and which had served his turn so well, came near being the
death of him. Passing too close to her heels one evening, the
vicious brute gave him a kick in the side, and broke two of his
ribs, which eventually ended in his being discharged from the
regiment.</p>

<p>I might here pause, and give a description of the stragglers
(among whom I found myself for the first time.) The mass of
stragglers, as a general thing, are composed of men who become
worn out with marching, or who are too foot-sore to keep up
with their respective battalions, and fall behind, keeping on as
best they can, and generally rejoining the regiments when they
bivouac, though, of course, some hours after the halt for the
night takes place. Some&mdash;often a great portion&mdash;of them,
however, straggle for the sake of picking up stray fowls,
victuals, and whatever else palatable which might fall in their
way; and it was an amusing study to watch these fellows scattered
and squatted along the roadside, or snugly ensconced in
the angles of the fences, leisurely engaged in the work of plucking
geese, turkies and other fowl, or skinning and dissecting
dead porkers. Sometimes a cow would be met with and slain,
and then quite a number of these stragglers would congregate,
light a fire, and proceed to roast and devour the not unsavory
pieces of flesh hewn from the still quivering carcase. There is,
of course, a rear-guard to each brigade; but they do not succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in keeping the men moving fast enough, and are generally compelled
to 'let them slide.' Some of the stragglers, however, take
a different method of prosecuting their researches, and, instead
of falling behind, push ahead, and spread themselves like locusts
on each flank, and generally make a clean sweep of all things
eatable in their course.</p>

<p>The army bivouacked for the night within about five miles of
Whitehall. In the morning, just before we started, a difficulty
occurred between Billy Patterson and a little drummer. Words
grew hot, and the drummer, making a demonstration on Billy's
physiognomy, the latter (a burly, double-fisted fellow), as if
resolved to die in the last ditch, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, be&mdash;&mdash;, a man has got to die but once, and I might as
well die now"&mdash;</p>

<p>But his further utterance was stopped by the little drummer
springing up and dealing him a 'sockdologer' under the ear.
Before Billy could draw in his skirmishers, however, and prepare
for a general engagement, an officer stepped up and separated
the belligerents.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock on Tuesday, our advance came up with
the enemy at Whitehall, who, after a sharp skirmish, retired
across the river, burning the bridge behind them.</p>

<p>Whitehall consisted of one house, which looked as if it never
knew a coat of paint, and why it was called by that name has
been a mystery to me to this day. The only reasonable solution
I can give to the apparent misnomer is, that a man named
White, or a white man, lived there.</p>

<p>Upon the advance of our forces towards the river&mdash;a feint
being made as if we intended to cross the same&mdash;the enemy
opened on us from the opposite side with artillery and musketry.
They had also a number of sharpshooters in the tree-tops, and
other advantageous positions on the other bank, who kept up a
continuous and pelting fire upon us, with perfect impunity, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for we could not see them, though they could see us, and picked
off many of our poor fellows.</p>

<p>The 17th were ordered down to the river bank on the right
of the road, and got into a hornet's nest and no mistake; for
the shells burst around and among us, and the bullets made the
air vocal with their insinuating p-e-w-phet; but though we
had quite a number wounded, not one of our number was killed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i098.jpg" width="600" height="375" alt="" />
</div>

<p>While being actively engaged upon the river bank, our own
artillery had come up, and commenced pelting at the rebs in
glorious style. We had six batteries (forty-two pieces) in the
expedition, and here they were all brought into play. The
enemy had also a good share of artillery, and when they all got
into full working order, what with the bursting of shells and
the diapason of small arms, the ground fairly shook with the
reverberations.</p>

<p>The wooded bank of the river, in which the 17th were posted,
becoming dangerous from the fire of our artillery, which ripped
through the trees and drove the splinters about in all directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
wounding some of our men, Col. Amory sent in his aide with
instructions for Lt. Col. Fellows to draw his men further to the
rear. I was sitting cosily on the edge of a sloping bank, my
legs astride the butt of a tree, and anxiously dodging my
head about in search of a sharp-shooter who was, as I had occasion
to believe, exclusively engaged in the endeavor to put me
out of suspense and existence at the same time, when the
aide came up and inquired where the Lt. Col. was. Perhaps
it was officiousness on my part to direct him in the most safe
and expeditious way to find Lt. Col. Fellows, who, as usual was
at the front; for, without noticing my directions he proceeded
further, and came near faring much worse. Just as he was
taking advantage of an opening in the underbrush to go down
the bank, whizz-herr-r-r-bang came a shell from the enemy
which passed within two feet of him. He drew back, pale, and
looking frightened enough; but, rallying, he proceeded a few
yards further; but, just as he had found another opening, one
of our batteries sent a discharge ripping through the woods just
in front of him again, when, thinking, probably, he had gone
far enough in that direction, he came to the right about, and
sought the path I pointed out to him in the first place.</p>

<p>Our regiment was withdrawn about one hundred yards to the
rear, ordered to lay down, and remained there under fire for
three hours. We had, however, time to smoke, and take a survey
of the battle-field on our left. The batteries were thundering
away, and the regiments which were ordered in on the left
of the road (among which were the 23d, 44th and 45th), were
tiring rapidly, and losing heavily, if one could form a judgment
from the way in which the ambulance corps were carrying the
wounded to the rear. Not only did the infantry suffer from
the fire of the enemy, but the batteries which were most advanced
suffered their share of the casualties.</p>

<p>A sergeant, of Belger's battery I think, was in the act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
dismounting from his horse, when a shot or shell passed through
the animal, and hit the sergeant, tearing the left side completely
out of him.</p>

<p>One of our men wishing to have a better view of some object
in his front, elevated his head, and opened his mouth, when a
rifle ball passed into the cavity, and out at the back of his neck,
the first intimation of which we had was a stream of blood
spirting out of his mouth.</p>

<p>Major John G. Chambers was in command of the 23d, and
marched his men in under fire; then formed them in line of
battle, and I could not help noticing the extreme coolness of this
officer in giving the order, in a deliberate voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captains of companies, see to your allinements."</p>

<p>Before the engagement had any sign of abating, the 17th
were ordered to take up the advance for Goldsboro. We had
to pass across the battle-ground under fire every step of the
way; but, strange to say, no casualties occurred during this
movement. We halted opposite the house which constituted the
city or town of Whitehall, when we were accosted by an enthusiastic
but prudent defender of his country, who had taken
shelter in the lee of the house, safe from the enemy's bullets,
who exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I say, boys, aint we giving 'em hell?"</p>

<p>Bestowing upon the hero a few 'O you be d&mdash;ds,' we resumed
our march, and soon left the fierce cannonade far behind
us.</p>

<p>The battle of Whitehall was little more than an artillery-duel,
and would be deserving only of a few lines of record if it
occurred on the Potomac or the Rapidan. I think, in the engagement,
which lasted about four and a half hours, there must
have been a great deal of lead wasted and iron thrown away
on our side. The only sensible impression made by our projectiles,
that we could see, was upon the frame of a gunboat on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the stocks at the other side of the river (intended for an iron-clad),
and this was certainly riddled up in fine style.</p>

<p>The mention of the gunboat, or frame of one, puts me in
mind of a daring act performed the evening previous to the
battle by one of the 3d New York cavalry. He stripped off,
swam the river, and was in the act of setting the gunboat on
fire, when he was discovered and fired upon, and had to dive
into the river, leaving his work undone, and swim back again
amid a perfect shower of bullets, not one of which, strange to
relate, touched him.</p>

<p>The loss on our side at Whitehall was about 30 killed and
120 wounded.</p>

<p>Our regiment was followed by the 9th New Jersey and others,
until all the infantry were under full headway, leaving only a
battery and a company of cavalry to engage the attention of the
enemy until nightfall.</p>

<p>We continued our march to within about five miles of Steep
Creek, and eight of the Wilmington Railroad, and halted for
the night.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning our regiment, followed by the 9th
New Jersey, again took up the advance, and proceeded cautiously
along to within about two miles of the railroad, where,
as we came out upon the brow of a hill, we could see about a
mile in our front the gleaming of the enemy's arms, as they
slowly withdrew. Our advance companies came up with them,
and quite a lively skirmish ensued, in which Sergeant Hardy of
Co. F was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Lt. Col. Fellows seemed in his element, and went on even in
advance of the skirmishers.</p>

<p>A battery had been planted on the hill just mentioned, and
commenced shelling the retreating rebels.</p>

<p>We advanced through a wood, skirting the mill pond, and,
just on the further edge of the wood, where we struck the county<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
road, we came upon a deserted rebel camp, the fires still
burning, and in the ashes of which many roasted sweet potatoes
were found.</p>

<p>After a short halt, we advanced along the county road which
crossed the railroad about a mile to the south of the railroad
bridge over the Neuse river, on arriving at which place abundant
evidences were manifest of a hasty preparation to receive
us, abandoned in greater haste, the hoes and shovels used in
making rifle-pits and breastworks being left in confusion along
the track. Axes were immediately brought into requisition, the
telegraph posts cut down and the wires destroyed.</p>

<p>We halted a few minutes just beyond the railroad, and, two
companies being sent out as skirmishers to the left, took up our
march on the track towards the bridge, which it was the purpose
of the expedition to destroy.</p>

<p>This bridge was a magnificent structure, about 200 feet long,
and is said to have taken twelve months to build.</p>

<p>The 17th had proceeded but a quarter of the distance, however,
when they were opened upon by a battery placed on the
track across the bridge, which, having the exact range of our
position sent shot and shell into us with terrible accuracy.</p>

<p>The track was immediately cleared, the regiment dividing,
taking each side of the railroad, (the bed of which there rose to
an elevation of about ten feet,) and gradually advanced towards
the bridge. The fire from the battery and sharpshooters on
each side of the railroad, became so continuous and heavy that
it was difficult to tell whether moving along or laying still was
most dangerous; but we kept pressing on, returning the fire as
best we could. Our firing was rapid, but, though the bullets
flew into where the enemy were supposed to be, yet I doubt if
they did much execution.</p>

<p>While advancing cautiously onward, and during one of those
pauses in our progress rendered prudent by the iron and leaden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
hail directed against us, an incident occurred, which impressed
me at the time as being truly ludicrous. A Co. K man, named
Gately, who was hugging the side of the railroad with commendable
zeal, was approached by a rebel of the canine species,
which, with that instinct that often approaches to reason, and is
at times wonderfully developed in this species of animal, seemed
to realize that he was in the midst of danger, and sought the
nearest place of shelter. For this purpose, he insinuated himself
between the soldier and the ground. The man not relishing
the companionship, from prudential reasons, no doubt&mdash;an
inch of elevation in the position he then was affording so much
of an additional mark for bullets or erratic pieces of shell,&mdash;endeavored
to dislodge him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Clear out of this, d&mdash;n you!"</p>

<p>But the dog would not stay repulsed, and again returned.</p>

<p>"Give him the butt of the musket!" suggested Phil. Mealley,
(another of Co. K's men), "knock him over into the ditch!"</p>

<p>This suggestion was acted upon, and the dog driven off.</p>

<p>As we were marching down the railroad in the first place,
and when the enemy opened upon us, the cry was raised among
the men&mdash;Billy Patterson's stentorian voice being among the
loudest&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unfurl the flag!"</p>

<p>"Let the d&mdash;d rebs see what we fight under!"</p>

<p>"Show them our colors!"</p>

<p>A man named Carney, of Co. I, who was color-sergeant, immediately
responded to the call, and shook out the folds of the
old 'star spangled banner;' and there he stood on the railroad
track, alone, for half an hour, a mark for the enemy's sharpshooters;
but, strange to relate, though two of the color guard
who were lying down behind him were wounded, and the old
flag riddled with bullets, he received not a scratch. This act of
true bravery, no matter how ill-advised it might have been, is, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
think, deserving of a record, and the honor of this deed should
be given to the man who so nobly faced death while upholding
his country's flag.</p>

<p>Having progressed in the manner described about half a
mile, somebody gave the order, and every one repeated it, to
form on the railroad, and charge across the bridge&mdash;what for,
except to take the battery just beyond, which had so annoyed
us, I could not understand. Supposing however, that everything
was correct, I scrambled up the bank and took my place
with the rest. Then with a shout and a cheer we commenced
the charge on the double quick; but had not proceeded twenty
yards when, from the skirt of woods bordering the field on our
left there came&mdash;tr-r-r-r-r&mdash;a volley of musketry fired by file,
followed in half a minute's time by another volley delivered at
once. (I should judge from the length of the line that no less
than three regiments fired each time). And then commenced
a scene that it would be vain to attempt a description of, especially
by an actor in it. In less time than I can relate it, every
man who was not wounded, had jumped, tumbled headlong or
rolled over into the ditch at the right of the track, and the regiment
apparently thrown into the wildest confusion. I have
been told that those who witnessed the scene thought for the
moment that the 17th were cut to pieces; but were agreeably
surprised to see the brave fellows spring up again, and commence
a rapid fire upon the enemy, using the elevated bed of
the railroad as a breastwork.</p>

<p>There were but four or five men wounded from these volleys.
The rebels, evidently mistaking the distance (about 200
yards), and the height of the railroad bed did not fire high
enough, and most of their bullets lodged in the bank at the
left&mdash;an extremely lucky circumstance for us all, as was also the
interruption to our progress thus given; for had we crossed the
bridge few of us would ever have returned to tell the tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>When the sound of the first volley struck my ear, I involuntarily
turned my head to see where it came from, and I mentally
remarked&mdash;"What splendid file-firing!" But when the
second volley burst out at once, the smaller sounds uniting to
swell the volume into a deafening crash, I was too absorbed in
calculations upon whether any of the musical messengers of
death singing about my ears, were intended for my especial
misfortune, and hesitating among the confused mass of men
what to do with myself, when, just as a shell burst close over
me, I received a knock on the left side which doubled me up,
and I toppled over, with the others, head heels into the ditch.
The breath was knocked out of me, but sensibility remained;
and, strange to say, while falling the short distance down the
bank, I made twice over this mental calculation&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the bullet [I thought it was a bullet, and went quite clean
through me, for I felt the pain equally in both sides] has not
gone through my stomach I may get over it. If it has, I'm a
goner, sure."</p>

<p>Picking myself up, as best I could, and, with a rueful visage,
I suppose, replying to the inquiries of my comrades if I was hit,
I took off my blanket, unbuckled my belt, and proceeded to
search for the wound. I will freely acknowledge, that at this
time my thoughts were not of the most lively character; but,
upon searching and finding no wound save a painful bruise, I
could have jumped for joy, and felt better pleased than if I had
come into possession of the best plantation in North Carolina.
In picking myself up after the tumble just described, I noticed
the 9th New Jersey, who had advanced down the field to our
right, retire on the order at the double-quick. And yet, afterwards,
in Gen. Foster's report, this regiment received all the
credit for what the 17th had done.</p>

<p>After a while Morrison's battery came thundering along, and
got into position in the field at the right of the railroad, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
commenced hurling shot and shell into the enemy in fine style.</p>

<p>The men were loading and firing away in splendid fashion,
though I think with questionable results, and, catching the
spirit of the occasion, I added my feeble quota to their efforts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i106.jpg" width="600" height="386" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At one time, after discharging my piece over the railroad,
and coming down to reload&mdash;the shot and shell of the enemy
screaming and bursting over and around us, they having
brought a number of their batteries to bear upon our particular
position&mdash;I beheld one of our men (a very young fellow), with
his head punched into the bank; and looking the picture of bewilderment
and terror. Seeing that he appeared unhurt, I
questioned him while loading my piece:</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Why don't you fire?" [No answer.]</p>

<p>"Is your piece loaded?" "Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, d&mdash;n you, get up, and act like a man!"</p>

<p>But he was too terrified to move, and I left him in disgust,
although pitying the infirmity that should have deterred him
from ever entering the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>I have omitted to state that half a dozen of the marines,
whom we had been guarding, had volunteered into Co. I (our
smallest company in point of numbers), and in this engagement
they acted with great gallantry. Our men were crowding the
embankment towards the bridge, and one of the marines anxious
to have his share of the fun, sung out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Make room for a marine, there, will you?"</p>

<p>"Bully for the marine!" shouted the boys, as they made way
for him.</p>

<p>One of our fellows had taken shelter behind a log, and a
non-commissioned officer observing the act, routed him out, telling him
to go forward and do his duty. The man departed, and
the officer took his place, snugly ensconcing himself behind the
log.</p>

<p>Lt. Col. Fellows was continually going up and down the line,
encouraging his men, showing them by his example a pattern of
the most fearless bravery.</p>

<p>Lieut. Graham, of the Artillery, went forward with combustibles
to fire the bridge, but soon returned pell-mell, jumping
behind a log, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n them, they won't give a fellow the ghost of a chance
out there!"</p>

<p>An order then came to form into line, and I thought it a case
of particular hardship in taking up my place in the ranks to
have to stand upon a log, which elevated me about two feet
above my comrades, and thereby exposed me more to the flying
shot and shell of our own batteries, as well as those of the enemy;
for our own shells were bursting just over us, and Morrison's
battery was belching forth its destructive missiles just above
our heads.</p>

<p>The order was given, and we marched out from behind the
embankment, and were halted in the rear of Morrison's battery,
and ordered to lie down in a hollow made by taking earth for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the bed of the railroad. The rebels seemed to have the exact
range of the position, and the way the shell and solid shot
scattered and tore up the earth about us, and in our midst, was
a caution. Col. Fellows alone stood, and some of the officers
were remonstrating with him upon the rashness of thus exposing
himself, when a shell at that moment came screaming by, apparently
within a few feet of his head&mdash;</p>

<p>"Phew! there she goes!" exclaimed Col. Fellows; and replying
to the officers, he said&mdash;"Well, it appears to me, that it is
just as safe standing here, as lying down; if a man is to be
hit, he'll be hit lying down as well as in any other position!"</p>

<p>"Poor philosophy, Colonel," I thought, "but very inspiriting
words."</p>

<p>Lieut. Barnabas F. Mann then came forward, with a bundle
of prepared combustibles in his hands, and called for two volunteers
to accompany him to the bridge, to operate with another
party in an endeavor to fire the same. The men were instantly
forthcoming, of course, and the trio started on their dangerous
errand. We watched them with anxiety, and saw them gain
the bridge amid a perfect death-shower of bullets, one of which,
unfortunately, hit our brave Lieut. Mann on the plate of his
belt, causing a severe contused wound. They returned with
the wounded officer, reporting that they did not succeed in
their enterprise; but were mistaken, as will be seen presently.</p>

<p>Faint cheers were now heard from the rebels, and on looking
to ascertain the cause, it was discovered that a train had arrived
with reinforcements, which could be seen rapidly defiling from
the cars and forming in line of battle across the railroad. Capt.
Morrison learning this, immediately jumped upon the railroad,
and directed the fire of his battery. The first shell fired fell
rather to the left of the rebel line. The second fell in their
midst almost on the railroad track, and the way they scattered
into the woods was amusing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>A 'monitor' or battery came up with this train, and immediately
commenced shelling us, every shell bursting directly
above our heads. At the third fire from Morrison's battery, the
shell exploded the engine, and a column of white smoke shot
up into the air, carrying with it, no doubt, the lives of many
poor rebels.</p>

<p>The enemy's fire began to slacken, and just as another
attempt was about to be made to fire the bridge, smoke could be
seen issuing from it, and soon the whole structure was wrapped
in flames. The most important part of the work was accomplished.</p>

<p>In the meantime the work of tearing up the rails and sleepers
of the railroad, and setting them on fire, was efficiently performed
by the gallant 5th Mass. regiment and the New York
Cavalry, the latter destroying another railroad bridge about two
miles north of the great bridge; and when the fight was concluded
I had time to notice the smoke of hundreds of fires, extending
as far as the eye could reach on the bed of the road,
indicating how completely the work of demolition had been
accomplished.</p>

<p>Our regiment then marched out from under fire, and were
received with cheers from all the other regiments that had come
up to our support.</p>

<p>We then took up the advance on the return movement; but
had not proceeded far, when we heard firing, and cheers of
men, indicating that the fighting was not yet over, and soon an
order reached us to halt. We were formed in line of battle, in
case the forces in front would be compelled to retreat; but after
a half hour's suspense in this position, were ordered again to
the scene of our late labors, where we arrived in time to see the
tail end of the fight, and to find we were not needed.</p>

<p>It appears that just after we had retired from the field, and
towards sunset, the rebels having crossed the county bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
some two or three miles above, to the number of three or four
thousand, came down and charged across the railroad upon battery
B, 3d New York Artillery. They formed in three lines of
battle and came on with a terrible swoop intending to crush all
before them.</p>

<p>The captain of the battery ordered his pieces to be loaded
with double charge of grape and canister, and when they came
within about sixty yards, sent a hail storm into their midst which
mowed them down like grass, and before they could rally or fly,
sent another discharge into them which threw them into such
confusion that they incontinently fled, and were seen no more.
The 5th Massachusetts was supporting this battery, and received
great praise for its gallant behaviour. About forty prisoners
were taken, and if the artillery supports had charged, no doubt
many more would have been captured.</p>

<p>Our aid not being required, we went to the right about, and
again took up the backward track; but though night had fallen
on the scene, our way was not in darkness; for, some of the men&mdash;stragglers,
perhaps&mdash;of the advanced regiments, had amused
themselves in setting the woods on fire, on each side of the road.
The scene was grand. The huge pitch-pines, which had been
stripped to obtain the gum, from which turpentine and rosin
were made, were ignited, and burned fiercely, and lined our
road on either side like flaming sentinels. The underbrush had
also caught, as well as the dried leaves, and with their volume
of light added, rendered our pathway as clear and distinct as if
the noonday sun poured down his burning beams. The heavy
and regular tread of the marching battalions; the rumbling of
the artillery and the baggage wagons and ambulances; the
braying of mules; the confused hum of voices; the occasional
cry of pain from the wounded men; the fierce, flaming, crackling,
and cracking of the trees on fire; the occasional crashes of
the falling giants of the forest; and the illuminated cloud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
smoke which hung over all, made up a picture of sight and
sound that, once witnessed, can never be forgotten.</p>

<p>I was tired, weary, bruised, and exhausted, and felt truly
glad when we halted for the night, which we did in the same
place we had bivouacked the night previous.</p>

<p>We resumed our march next morning; but I could not keep
up, and arrived at the bivouac long after the regiment had
stacked arms. But on emerging from the wood in full view of
the encampment, I beheld a sight which was the grandest I ever
witnessed. The ground rose to a considerable elevation from
and on each side of the road, on both sides of which were encamped
the infantry, cavalry and artillery. I could see the
long lines of bivouac fires extending to the woods on either side,
and the swarthy visages of the men as they moved around, or
gathered about the fires, smoking and talking over the events of
the day; and, what with the braying of mules and the barking
of isolated and astonished dogs, there came a hum from the
host that resembled the murmuring of 'many waters.' Added
to this sight of magnificence the surrounding woods on fire, and
the crashing of falling trees and branches, which might lead to
the delusion that quite a number of small skirmishes were going
on at the same time, and you will have some faint idea of the
picture that met my gaze. To one unacquainted with military
matters, looking upon that scene, it would appear that instead
of an army of fifteen or twenty thousand men, there were at
least double or treble that number encamped before him.</p>

<p>On our return, we were accompanied by a goodly number of
escaped slaves, and any one who beheld the processions of these
escaped bondmen&mdash;and they were dotted all through and along
the line&mdash;men, women and children, and witnessed the patient
and even cheerful manner in which they toiled along, with all
they could hastily gather up in their flight, would be convinced
that their love of liberty was prompted by more than an indefinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
idea of the blessings of independence. I could not help occasionally
smiling at the grotesque appearance of some of the
females, who had, apparently, left the more useful articles of
their own wardrobe, to indulge in the inevitable female taste for
finery and gewgaws, by 'confiscating' and bringing off in triumph
some of their late mistresses' finery. Some were apparently
unmarried, and they carried the largest amount of 'plunder,'
while those who had children to carry or look after, could
not bring more than a few necessaries of life, and, perhaps, a
bed-quilt or blanket. Some had mules or carts; but the majority
were on foot. After a tedious and toilsome march of over
three days, in which no enemy annoyed our flanks, front or
rear, we arrived in Newbern, as 'hard' a looking set of men as
probably ever entered that city before. We were thankful,
however, that our toils and fighting were over for the present,
at least, and enjoyed the short repose granted us, ere we
resumed our duty as provost guard of Newbern.</p>

<p>The 17th regiment continued in the city until the 26th of
January, 1863, when it was relieved by the 45th, and went into
barracks near the old county bridge across the Trent river.
Here the regiment was engaged in doing picket duty, and constructing
earthworks under the superintendence of Major
Frankle, in which latter duty they were assisted by the 43d
Mass., encamped near by.</p>

<p>The winter wore away heavily enough, but was enlivened by
occasional dancing assemblies in the different companies' quarters,
each emulating the other in the taste displayed in their
decoration.</p>

<p>On the 14th of March (the anniversary of the battle of Newbern),
the enemy made an attack upon an entrenched camp of
two regiments of Wessells' brigade, across the Neuse river, and
at the same time attempted to shell the city; but the gunboat
Hunchback coming to the rescue, they were driven off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
The affair was a fizzle on the part of the enemy, although from
a sketch of it which I have seen in one of the New York illustrated
papers, the public might be led to suppose it was most
sanguinary and terrible.</p>

<p>I omitted to mention, in the proper place, the departure on
the 7th of Feb'y, '63, of an expedition composed of a portion
of the 18th Army Corps and Gen. Peck's Division of the Army
of the Potomac, which arrived from Norfolk in January. This
expedition, upon which so much was counted, proved a failure,
owing to a disagreement between Gens. Foster and Hunter as
to which general should have the chief command and direction
of affairs in the operations against Charleston; and, as Foster
could not have his own way, he withdrew a considerable portion
of his forces, and with them returned to North Carolina in
March.</p>

<p>About the first of April, the rebel Generals Hill and Garnett,
with about fifteen thousand troops invested Little Washington,
and erected batteries so as to command the approaches by
water. Gen. Foster arrived the day it was invested, and great
fears were entertained for his safety as well as that of the garrison.
The rebels commenced a vigorous bombardment of the
position, but after fifteen days pounding, and being pounded in
turn, they fell back, and raised the siege. During all this time
we could distinctly hear the sound of the cannonade, although
the scene of conflict was fifteen or twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April, the 17th formed part of an expedition
undertaken for the relief of the besieged city; but upon approaching
a place called Blounts' Mills, the enemy was discovered
in force strongly entrenched. A severe skirmish ensued,
the 17th losing seven men and an officer wounded, when the
position being found too strong, the troops were withdrawn, and
the expedition returned, without having accomplished anything.
The expedition renewed its attempt on the 17th of April, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
reached Washington on the 22d, without opposition, the enemy
having previously withdrawn.</p>

<p>On the 27th, the 17th with the other regiments of the brigade,
including the 45th Mass., started on an expedition to Green
Swamp, upon the railroad leading to Kinston. On the 28th, at
a place called Sandy Ride, near Cove or Cole Creek, the enemy
were encountered, and the 45th advanced towards where
they were entrenched, and would, no doubt have driven them
out in fine style, for the 45th was really a good fighting regiment,
but the Col. (Codman) hesitated, not from fear, I think, but ill-judged
prudence, when two companies of the 17th were ordered
up by Lt. Col. Fellows, and marched into the enemy's works,
which they found abandoned. The expedition returned to its
bivouac of the night previous, amidst a drenching rain, having
marched nineteen miles in nine hours.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July, the 17th formed part of an expedition
under Gen. Heckman, and proceeded to Warsaw, where they
made some important captures of rebel stores, and destroyed
salt works, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the 1st of October, the 17th again assumed the provost
duty of Newbern, relieving the 27th Mass., where it has, I
believe, remained ever since.</p>

<p>The rebels had during the winter of 1863, made several
feints upon Newbern, and drove in our pickets at various times,
but never approached nearer the city than ten miles. During
the Fall of '63, after the nine months troops had been all withdrawn
from the department, their time having expired, the comparatively
small garrison had been still further depleted by Gen.
Butler (who succeeded Gen. Foster as department commander)
for the purpose of strengthening other posts. The rebels fully
aware of this, determined upon the capture of Newbern, and,
during January, collected a force of 15,000 or 20,000 men at
Kinston, and on the 26th, reached our outposts, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
drove in. About 114 men of the various companies of the 17th
under command of Lieut. Col. Fellows, went to the assistance
of the pickets at Batchelder's Creek, and on the 1st of Feb.
were attacked by an overwhelming force of rebels, and lost
eight officers and fifty men taken prisoners, and one killed and
four wounded. Among the prisoners were Lieut. Col. Fellows,
Adjutant Cheever (wounded), Capt. Lloyd (wounded), and
Lieuts. B. F. Mann and Comins. But the rebs didn't get Newbern,
although they captured Plymouth and its brave commander
(Gen. Wessells), and the heroic garrison under his
command. And after all the blood shed in the efforts to hold
Little Washington, it has been abandoned to the enemy. Let
us hope that the same policy will not be pursued in the case of
Newbern, which is certainly one of the most important and
strongly fortified posts held by our army on the coast.</p>

<p>I was taken sick in April, and sent down to Beaufort with
thirty or forty other sick men. We took the cars at Newbern,
and in about three hours were transported from the heat and
dust of the interior to the cool, bracing air of the sea coast. On
the way down I noticed that the country we passed through
seemed little better than a continuation of swamps. We passed
Havelock station, where a block-house had been erected in the
midst of a swamp, and I pitied the poor fellows whose duty it
would be to garrison that post during the coming warm season.
Further on we came to clearing, and saw a line of breastworks
behind which it was intended to dispute the advance of Burnside's
forces in their march from Slocum's Creek to Newbern,
but which he drove them from with little trouble. Newport
Barracks, about ten miles from Morehead City, was a collection
of some dozen houses, and the quarters of the cavalry and infantry
pickets in that section. Carolina City was next reached,
but where the city was I couldn't for the life of me make out.
It was not anything like so grand a place as Newport Barracks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and I should not have known of its whereabouts but for the
camp of the 23d Mass., which was said to be in the city. We
next passed through Morehead City to the railroad terminus or
wharf, about a mile further on. Morehead consists of one or
two hotels, and forty or fifty houses and stores. A number of
steamers and transports were laying at and off the railroad
wharf. To the south, across the sound, I beheld Fort Macon,
and anchored abreast of it and inside the sound were ships of
all descriptions, from the captured blockade runner to the huge
blockaders which were taking their rest and preparing to resume
their dangerous duties off Wilmington, relieving in turn some
other blockader. The city of Beaufort lay to the eastward, and
looked much larger than it really was, and quite imposing.</p>

<p>While waiting for transportation, and looking at the various
objects of interest around, my eye lit upon an individual (a sergeant
in the&mdash;Mass.) whom I instantly recognized as having
seen at Camp Cameron, whither he had been detailed to gather
up recruits. But what a change had been wrought in his
appearance! When I saw him at Cambridge he was full of
life, spirit, confidence, and business&mdash;and drove a profitable
trade there in the retail of porter, ale, &amp;c. (under the rose, of
course.) Now he looked cheerless and forlorn&mdash;utterly 'played
out,' and as anxious as the most peacefully inclined rebel that
'this cruel war' should be ended. Hard marching, hard beds,
hard usage, hard fighting and hard tack, had evidently left their
mark upon him. And yet he was not sick&mdash;only dispirited a
little.</p>

<p>A boat being at length in readiness we embarked, and after
an hour's sail reached the Hammond Hospital at Beaufort. This
hospital was in a building or series of buildings formerly known
as Pender's Hotel, and was one of the most considerable and
extensive of its class in Beaufort, and before the war was the
summer residence of many planters and their families from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
interior who made this city their watering place. The main
structure was built out upon the shore, on piles, so that the tide
ebbed and flowed under it, and was altogether one of the most
delightful places I have seen in that section. The former owner
(Pender) was among the first and most active in the secession
movement in North Carolina, and, with a company of men he
had raised in Beaufort, took possession of Fort Macon; but
Burnside came along, and after taking Newbern, Morehead City
and Beaufort, leisurely proceeded to knock him and his fellow
traitors and their arrangements into a 'cocked hat,' and Pender
was taken prisoner and forced to leave his fine hotel, with its
plate, furniture and bedding, behind him; and the story went
that the negroes, the poor whites who remained, and some of the
officers of a Rhode Island regiment divided the spoils.</p>

<p>The city of Beaufort is well laid out and looks quite pleasant
from the water; but though there are a few good dwellings and
some old-fashioned stores, the houses are scattering and the sand
ankle-keep in the streets. In fact, the city is built upon a bank
of sand; and how the inhabitants managed to cultivate gardens
was a mystery to me&mdash;but they did make gardens, and in some
instances very creditable ones. The soil, however, seemed too
sandy for any fruit trees but the fig, which flourished in great
plenty. The majority of the people&mdash;who, I judge, never exceeded
two thousand in number&mdash;seemed to live by fishing and
gathering shells. Beaufort is so situated within the folds of a
marsh, and the approaches to it are so intricate and shallow, that
it can never become a place of any great commercial importance&mdash;Morehead
City will be its successful rival in that respect.</p>

<p>We (that is, the sick men) were assisted to land, and, after
our names were checked and our surgeons' certificates or assignments
deposited, shown to our ward room; and, to tell the
truth, we had no cause to complain of our new quarters, which
were pleasantly situated in the main building, commanding an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
extensive view of the harbor and the sea beyond. The beds
were really good&mdash;but to us poor devils who had known nothing
of the kind since leaving home, they appeared truly luxurious.
A little experience in the productions of the culinary department
of the hospital, however, did not impress us so favorably with that
part of the programme. The bread was often hard and mouldy,
and the beef as solid as a frozen turnip and salt as Lot's wife.
As for the soup, it was whispered around that it was nothing
but sea water in which salt junk was boiled, and a few carpenters'
shavings thrown in for vegetables&mdash;it was called 'salt-water
soup.' Of fresh meat I never tasted any in the hospital, while of
fish and oysters, which were in great abundance in the market,
I did not have more than two meals during the four weeks I
was in hospital. When we complained to our fellow patients
of the fare, they told us it was much better than it had been.</p>

<p>A few days after our arrival we were called up to undergo
examination by the hospital surgeon, Dr. Ainsworth. In answer
to one of his queries, we all told him we liked our quarters very
well, but complained about the poor quality of the 'grub.'</p>

<p>When Tom McNally (the hero of the kicking mare) came
up, Dr. Ainsworth asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what's the matter with you, sir?"</p>

<p>"O nothing particular," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"What were you sent here for, then?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;to recruit my health, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I see. I think you'd better go back to your regiment.
I send some others off tomorrow, and you can go with them."</p>

<p>"I'd just as soon go now, sir."</p>

<p>"No. You can't go till I send you."</p>

<p>"Well, for God's sake, give me something to eat while I am
here!" returned Tom.</p>

<p>"Here," said the doctor to the clerk, "make out papers for
this man, and have him sent off immediately!" Then, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
another sip from a glass on the counter beside him, which looked
like whisky, he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"These 17th men seem hard to please. I shouldn't wonder
if they boarded at the Revere House before they came into the
army!"</p>

<p>That the hospital at Beaufort was not well conducted, I could
plainly see, though to a visitor everything seemed to work well.
And I was reminded of a reply made to an observation of mine
to one of the patients in a general hospital at Newbern, that
everything seemed favorable to the comfort and recovery of the
sick&mdash;"Ah," he replied, "what you see is all very well&mdash;but
there are many things you don't see!"</p>

<p>It was so with the Hammond Hospital at Beaufort. A pack
of idle, worthless fellows, in the enjoyment of the most robust
health&mdash;who should have been doing duty with their regiments
in the field&mdash;were employed as clerks and orderlies, who, by a
system of espionage upon the actions of the men and of persecution
to all who incurred their displeasure, exercised a kind of
petty tyranny which made them obnoxious but at the same time
feared. These understrappers, while the patients were often
deprived of some of the most common and desirable necessaries,
reveled in the choicest dishes and delicacies to be obtained, including
wines and preserves. This I have seen myself, and
mentally contrasted it with the coarse fare of the poor patients
who were forced to swallow the barely parboiled salt junk and
dry bread, and the abominable milkless and unsweetened slops
dignified with the name of tea or coffee.</p>

<p>And yet there was one man in authority, who seemed to do
all in his power to remedy the too palpable evils. This was
the assistant surgeon, Dr. Vaughan&mdash;a New Yorker, I believe.
He was a kind, humane man&mdash;and to his exertions were due, in
a great measure, the reforms that had been made in affairs. I
have seen him day after day in the kitchen enforcing a reform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in its arrangements; and I noticed, too, that on such occasions
our meals were so much better than usual as to elicit remarks
of satisfaction from the partakers.</p>

<p>'Red tape,' I presume, is indispensable in the conduct of all
affairs pertaining to Government; but no where does its knotted
folds tighten with more deadly effects around the destiny of its
victims than in the hospitals. Hundreds die in the hospitals
every year, who, if transferred to their homes at the North,
might recover&mdash;if not, they would at least have the consolation
of dying among their friends, which is the least that might be
accorded by the Government to the poor fellows who become
disabled in its service; but as they can not be sent North without
a discharge from the service, and often while the discharge
papers are passing through the tedious processes of signature
('the mill of the gods grinds slowly') the unfortunate patient
becomes impatient, fretful and gloomy at the delay, and that
'hope deferred which maketh the heart sick' in many cases
increases the virulence of the disease or brings on a relapse&mdash;and
the poor fellow, so lately warmed with the pleasing hope of
seeing once more his friends and his home, closes forever in
blank despair his eyes in the bitterness of death.</p>

<p>[Since the above was written, I find that, through the efforts
of Governors of different States and other good men in power,
this evil has been partially remedied. I would respectfully but
earnestly call the attention of those in power&mdash;and especially
our good Governor of Massachusetts, who has always been the
soldier's friend&mdash;to the adoption of some system whereby all
sick men who will bear transportation can be sent home to their
friends, and by this means thousands of lives may be saved.]</p>

<p>I will instance a case in point, to show the fatal effects of delay
in the matter of discharges of sick men. A young man,
named Palmer, who belonged to a New York regiment, was sent
to the hospital at Beaufort, very sick from chronic dysentery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
It was thought by the surgeons, after they had treated his case
for a while, that nothing could save his life but a change to a
more northern climate; but this could not be effected without a
discharge. They interested themselves, however, and the discharge
papers were forthcoming in an unusually short space of
time. The poor fellow, buoyed with the hope of again seeing
his friends, rallied a little, and actually gained considerably
in strength; but just as he had got on board the boat at the
wharf, which was to take him with a squad of other discharged
men to the steamer in waiting, an order came from the surgeon
that he must return, as there was some informality in his papers,
and a new set would have to be made out. The poor fellow
returned; but the shock occasioned by the disappointment was
too much for his enfeebled constitution to bear. A relapse ensued,
and in a few days he was a corpse&mdash;the victim of 'red
tape,' or incompetency, or criminal carelessness&mdash;which?</p>

<p>I have said the understrappers at the hospital made a 'good
thing' out of the necessities of the patients. They did more.
The whisky intended for hospital uses was not only used by
them, but frequently disposed of to the man-o'-war's men, who
paid liberally for the same. The loss to the hospital (or rather
the patients) was made up in this wise: When a pail-full of
whisky was drawn from the cask, it was said that an equal quantity
of water was thrown in&mdash;so that when the cask got pretty
well down from the withdrawal of the legitimate supplies for
hospital use, it was remarked by the patients that they got water
diluted with whisky, instead of whisky weakened with water as
in the earlier stages of this peculiar process.</p>

<p>There were many other things in the management of this
hospital open to criticism&mdash;though, doubtless, the fault did not
always lay at the door of the surgeon in charge. For example&mdash;there
was quite a large number of disabled men, whose discharge
papers had been made out and sent to headquarters for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
signature, but had been kept back two, three, and even six
months&mdash;for no reason whatever save some contemptible quibble
or pretense that these papers were not made out correctly.
Here were a large number of men unfit for any duty&mdash;some of
them permanently disabled, others in the last stages of decline,
and all anxious to be sent home as soon as possible, since they
could be of no further use to and only a burthen upon the Government&mdash;kept
against their own wishes, at a heavy public
expense, and all because Dr. So-and-so, or Medical Director
Bobolink, or their understrappers, were too indolent or careless
to do their duty properly. Many of the nine-months men who
had become disabled and were placed in the hospitals for discharge,
were retained for some time after their regiments had
been mustered out of service. No doubt it is a good and a very
charitable thing to retain disabled men in hospitals whose discharge
therefrom would throw them upon the charity of the
world; but cases of this kind are very rare. Nearly all have
friends who would willingly care for them, or belong to communities
who have providently considered such contingent demands
upon their charity, and made liberal arrangements to
that end. In any case, I believe the condition of such men
would be eminently improved by a transfer to the North&mdash;either
to their friends or to some convalescent hospital or home for
disabled soldiers.</p>

<p>I have now drawn towards the close of my narrative, and find
that, instead of having room left for an elaborate essay (were I
capable of writing one) upon the condition, character and habits
of the freedmen, I have only space for a few general remarks.
I do not regret this, however, when I reflect that there are many
others better qualified for such a task than me.</p>

<p>In the course of my experience with the contrabands, I have
been favorably impressed with their capacity for becoming a free
people. The negroes seem, as a general thing, to possess a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
superior vitality to the white men of the South; for, with comparatively
poor domestic arrangements and an inferior style of
nutriment, they seem to thrive better and be capable of greater
endurance and more continued physical exertion. They display
a thirst for knowledge&mdash;a desire for information&mdash;an indomitable
faculty of acquisitiveness, and a superior power of
imitation, which must lead the social philosopher to but one
conclusion, viz., their eminent fitness for advancement in the
social scale from the position of bondmen to that of freemen.
And the necessity of some such change in the social condition
of the negroes of the South cannot but be too apparent to every
fair-minded man who has beheld the universal manifestations of
the desire for freedom displayed by them. They are endowed
with a temperament at once docile and energetic, light and
serious. They have considerable aptitude for the mechanic arts,
and are probably, some of them, the best practical farmers of
the South. They are generally moral and deeply impressed
with the sacredness of religion; but it is true at the same time
that they have many petty vices&mdash;and the wonder is, that under
so debasing a system they have any virtues at all. Of the
length, breadth and depth of their mental capacity I do not pretend
to judge&mdash;all white men are not equal in that respect; and
I trust I am not one of those who believe that nothing good can
come out of Nazareth. As to the radical mental and physical
difference which is said to exist between the black and the
mulatto, I must confess I could never perceive it&mdash;there are
the weak, puny and imbecile of both shades of color, at well as
the strong and active, intelligent and energetic.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that, above all other things, the negroes
have an unbounded desire for freedom&mdash;extravagant only in the
risks it will cause them to run to obtain that boon; for, once
free, they are content&mdash;nay, happy&mdash;to begin on the most
humble scale to climb the ladder of fortune. They are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
domestic in their habits, and where they can find no habitation
ready for them when they come into our lines, will set to work,
and with such materials as very few white men would make
available, erect a hut&mdash;not an elaborate one, to be sure, but all
sufficient for their humble wants.</p>

<p>In and around Newbern I should judge there were from 5,000
to 8,000 escaped slaves, and of that number at least one half
were located in camps or collections of huts of their own construction
in different localities adjacent. There was one of
those on the left of the Trent road, near Fort Totten; another
near Fort Spinola on the other side of the Trent river, and a
third just across the railroad bridge and to the left of the railroad.</p>

<p>This latter village, inhabited by over one thousand negroes of
all ages and sexes, was under the supervision of Mr. G. R. Kimball,
of Nashua, N. H. (Mr. K. was formerly Sutler of the 17th.)
Upon expressing a desire to learn some facts in regard to the
negroes under his charge, he kindly offered to give me all the <ins title="Note: 'facts' omitted in original">facts</ins>
in his possession.</p>

<p>The adult negroes under Mr. Kimball's charge were all in the
employ of the Government&mdash;the females were engaged in cooking,
washing, and making pies and sweetmeats, for which they
found a ready sale among the soldiers. "And a more contented
and happy lot of mortals," said Mr. K., "you can not find anywhere."
This I verified from a personal inspection.</p>

<p>Among other places I visited the village school. It was kept
by a negro named Mack Bourne, and contained twenty-five
pupils. When I entered, Mack did not seem pleased at the intrusion,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, sojer&mdash;I dusent want any body in de sojer business
to come in here; for d'oder day one of you sojer men&mdash;he
cum'd in here, and he stole a testament from me&mdash;he did&mdash;a
bran new one, too&mdash;and I don't like sich work&mdash;I don't!"</p>

<p>I told him I did not come to take anything from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you cum for, den?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir," I replied, in a melo-dramatic tone, "I am a
member of the press, and take an interest in your welfare."</p>

<p>"You is&mdash;you do? De press&mdash;wha-what press&mdash;de ex-press?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;the printing press&mdash;for printing newspapers."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;Is you a-gwine to print a paper? I tought you was a
sojer!"</p>

<p>"And so I am, my friend; but I'm a printer also."</p>

<p>"Dus you make books like dis-a-one?" displaying a primer.</p>

<p>"Yes; I could print a book like that, or&mdash;a testament."</p>

<p>"Look here, sojer," he said, the remembrance of the loss he
had sustained making him suspicious&mdash;"I tink you'm foolin' me.
Now, sar, I dusent like to be fooled&mdash;I dusent!"</p>

<p>But I assured him I didn't want to fool him, and so pacified
him that he became confidential, and told me his history. He
was 'raised' in Plymouth, and had been taught to read by a
nephew of his master's, who gave him lessons on Sundays, on
the sly. None of his scholars had advanced beyond lessons in
spelling, and most of them were in the alphabet. The girls
seemed to make the most rapid progress; and two of these&mdash;named
respectively Rosette and Melvina&mdash;could spell words of
two syllables, after a tuition of only four weeks.</p>

<p>"Ise glad Ise free now&mdash;dat's so!" I one day heard a little
curly-headed ebony urchin say to another. They had just been
let out of school in Newbern. Struck by the oddity of the saying,
I stopped and questioned the lad&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why are you glad you're free, my little fellow?"</p>

<p>"'Cause, sar, I can go to school, and learn to read; and den&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, den de ole woman'll guv me heaps of sweet 'tater pies!"</p>

<p>When the Goldsboro expedition was about to start a requisition
for thirty negroes was made upon Mr. Kimball. These,
together with a like number from other camps, were to be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as auxiliaries to the pioneer corps. He called them together
and stated that an expedition was going off, that Gen. Foster
wanted thirty of them to go with it, and called for volunteers.
Only six men stepped forward in answer to the call.</p>

<p>"What," said he, "only six! Is that all the men I have?"</p>

<p>When one of the delinquents stepped forward and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"If we goes, Massa Kimball, will dey guv us guns?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you will have guns if you need them."</p>

<p>Upon this announcement they all came forward and offered
to go, and he had no easy task to select the thirty men required
from the eager crowd.</p>

<p>This was before Wild's brigade had an existence; but showed
that the negroes had manhood enough to fight for their freedom&mdash;which
they have since fully proved on many a bloody field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My task is done&mdash;would I could think it well done; but as it
is it must go forth, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, with 'all its
imperfections on its head.' I might have made it better&mdash;but I
did not. The world moves on rapidly&mdash;things get jumbled up
strangely in these troublous times&mdash;and, I suppose, the minds of
men get confused and jumbled up also, for sympathy is a law of
nature;&mdash;life is short, and greater men than I have made mistakes;
but no man who fights in the cause of mankind&mdash;of
universal freedom&mdash;can greatly err in its advocacy. The soldier
who braves the hardships and perils of the campaign and suffers
in a good cause, holds that cause dearer the more he endures
for it; and the remembrance of those scenes, filled with glowing
and startling pictures, often serves to renew that patriotic fire
which forever burns in a corner of his heart. The armies of
the rebellion have been flanked&mdash;the Confederacy will also soon
be flanked, and, like my book, must sooner or later come to an</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
